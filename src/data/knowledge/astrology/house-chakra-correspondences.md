# House–Chakra Correspondences
*Source: Astrological Alchemy — Stefano | AI Knowledge Excerpt*

## The Mapping

The 12 astrological houses correspond directly to the 7 chakra energy centers. The position of the Sun (and other planets) in a natal house reveals the primary chakra activated in this lifetime. Transits through houses activate the corresponding chakra's themes.

| House(s) | Chakra | Color | Theme |
|----------|--------|-------|-------|
| 10th | **Sahasrara — Crown** | Violet | Life purpose, vocation, public mission, highest expression |
| 9th & 11th | **Ajna — Third Eye** | Indigo | Philosophy, expansion, intuition, ideals, humanitarian vision |
| 8th & 12th | **Vishuddha — Throat** | Light Blue | Transformation, sexuality, mysticism, shadow integration, dissolution |
| 1st & 7th | **Anahata — Heart** | Green | Identity, self-expression, relationships, union, balance |
| 2nd & 6th | **Manipura — Solar Plexus** | Yellow | Work, health, resources, routines, materialization of purpose |
| 3rd & 5th | **Svadhisthana — Sacral/Splenic** | Orange | Intellect, communication, creativity, self-esteem, play |
| 4th | **Muladhara — Root** | Red | Ancestry, family patterns, foundations, belonging, roots |

## Interpretation Principles

**Sun in House as Chakra Activation:** When the natal Sun occupies a house, the corresponding chakra is the primary energy center this person is here to develop and express. This is the chakra most naturally activated by authentic solar expression.

**Planetary Transits:** When a transiting planet moves through a house, it activates the corresponding chakra's themes in the current moment of life. Saturn transiting the 4th house works the Root chakra — ancestry patterns, foundation rebuilding. Jupiter transiting the 9th house expands the Third Eye — intuition, faith, philosophical horizons.

**Sun through the Houses — Chakra Themes:**
- **Sun in 1st** → Heart chakra of identity — who am I authentically?
- **Sun in 2nd** → Solar Plexus of self-worth through resources
- **Sun in 3rd** → Sacral/Splenic of intellect, communication, curiosity
- **Sun in 4th** → Root chakra — purpose rooted in ancestry and belonging
- **Sun in 5th** → Sacral/Splenic of creative self-expression and joy
- **Sun in 6th** → Solar Plexus of work, service, health as purpose
- **Sun in 7th** → Heart chakra of relationships as path to self
- **Sun in 8th** → Throat chakra of transformation through depth
- **Sun in 9th** → Third Eye of wisdom, travel, philosophy as expansion
- **Sun in 10th** → Crown chakra — purpose visible in the world
- **Sun in 11th** → Third Eye of ideals, groups, future vision
- **Sun in 12th** → Throat chakra of dissolution, spirituality, collective unconscious

## Cross-Tradition Synthesis

The House→Chakra mapping creates a living bridge:
- **Astrology** reveals the house (where life expresses)
- **Chakra system** reveals the energy quality (how it vibrates)
- **Human Design** gates in those houses carry the same frequency
- **Gene Keys** at those gate positions carry the shadow/gift/siddhi of that chakra energy

**Example synthesis:** Saturn in 4th house = Root chakra restriction → HD Gate in that zodiac zone carries the lesson of ancestral patterns → the corresponding Gene Key reveals the shadow (family conditioning), gift (liberation from roots), and siddhi (complete groundedness as cosmic foundation).

## Usage in Contemplation

When discussing any planetary placement or transit, connect:
1. The house placement → its chakra
2. The chakra's core theme → what this energy is asking to develop
3. The shadow expression → what blocks this chakra's flow
4. The gift/integrated expression → what opens when this chakra is clear
5. The siddhi → the transcendent possibility of this placement
