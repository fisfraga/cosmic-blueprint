# The Seven Hermetic Principles
*Source: The Kybalion — Three Initiates | AI Knowledge Excerpt*

> "The lips of Wisdom are closed, except to the ears of Understanding."

These seven principles underlie all of creation. They are not beliefs but observations of universal law. Understanding them transforms how we read astrological charts, Gene Keys shadows, and Human Design mechanics — every system reflects these same underlying patterns.

## I. The Principle of Mentalism

**"THE ALL is MIND; The Universe is Mental."**

All that exists is a mental creation of THE ALL — infinite, eternal consciousness. Everything we perceive as material reality is thought vibrating at specific frequencies. This is not to say the world is illusion, but that consciousness is the medium through which all form arises.

**Astrological Application:** The natal chart is a map of the MIND's current configuration. Signs represent modes of thinking; houses reveal where mental attention naturally focuses; planets show the archetypal mental forces at play.

**Gene Keys Application:** The three frequencies (Shadow/Gift/Siddhi) are states of consciousness — mental realities that generate physical experiences. Shifting frequency is literally shifting the quality of mind.

**Contemplation Invitation:** "What if every challenge I face is a thought I haven't yet fully understood? What mental frequency am I broadcasting in this area of life?"

## II. The Principle of Correspondence

**"As above, so below; as below, so above; as within, so without; as without, so within."**

There is always a correspondence between the laws governing different planes of existence. The macrocosm is reflected in the microcosm. What is true of the cosmos is true of the individual. What is happening inwardly manifests outwardly.

**Astrological Application:** This is the metaphysical foundation of astrology itself. The movements of planets above correspond to cycles of development within and patterns of events without. The birth chart is the cosmos reflected in the individual.

**Human Design Application:** The BodyGraph is a correspondence map — each center, channel, and gate corresponds to a biological system, a psychological function, and a cosmic frequency.

**Contemplation Invitation:** "What external situation is reflecting an internal state? What does the cosmos showing me right now correspond to within my own inner landscape?"

## III. The Principle of Vibration

**"Nothing rests; everything moves; everything vibrates."**

All matter, energy, and consciousness exists in constant motion. The difference between forms of matter, energy, and spirit is simply a difference in rate of vibration. Mind can be trained to shift its vibration — this is the basis of all inner work.

**Gene Keys Application:** The spectrum from Shadow to Gift to Siddhi is literally a shift in vibrational frequency. The work of contemplation is the work of raising vibration — not bypassing lower frequencies but transforming them.

**Astrological Application:** Planetary transits are vibrational events — the meeting of cosmic frequencies with personal frequencies. Some harmonize; some challenge; all carry information.

**Contemplation Invitation:** "What is the quality of vibration I'm bringing to this area of life? What would it feel like to operate from a higher frequency here?"

## IV. The Principle of Polarity

**"Everything is Dual; everything has poles; everything has its pair of opposites; like and unlike are the same; opposites are identical in nature, but different in degree."**

All manifestation exists on a spectrum between two poles. Hot and cold are not opposites but degrees of the same thing. Love and hate are the same emotional energy at different frequencies. Courage and cowardice are the same quality at different intensities.

**Astrological Application:** The 12 signs exist in polarities (Aries/Libra, Taurus/Scorpio, etc.). Understanding that apparent opposites are poles of the same principle transforms how we read challenging aspects — they are not conflicts but conversations between two expressions of the same underlying energy.

**Gene Keys Application:** The Shadow and the Siddhi are poles of the same genetic potential. The shadow is not the enemy of the gift — it is the gift at a lower frequency, carrying the seed of its own transcendence.

**Contemplation Invitation:** "Where are the poles of this energy in my life? What would it look like to shift along this spectrum toward its higher expression?"

---

## V. The Principle of Rhythm

**"Everything flows, out and in; everything has its tides; all things rise and fall; the pendulum-swing manifests in everything; the measure of the swing to the right is the measure of the swing to the left; rhythm compensates."**

All movement occurs in rhythmic cycles. What moves toward one pole must eventually move toward the other. Seasons follow seasons; tides ebb and flow; enthusiasm follows withdrawal. The Principle of Rhythm teaches that apparent setbacks are part of natural oscillation, not failures.

**Astrological Application:** Planetary cycles ARE Rhythm made visible. Saturn returns, Jupiter cycles, lunar phases, and eclipses all mark the cosmic rhythms that move through individual life. Understanding the current phase of a cycle changes its meaning entirely.

**Human Design Application:** Different types have different rhythmic patterns — Generators with consistent energy that needs to be responded to; Projectors with episodic energy requiring rest; Manifestors with initiating bursts; Reflectors following the lunar cycle.

**Contemplation Invitation:** "Where is this experience in the natural rhythm? Is this an inward tide or an outward flow? What does this season want from me?"

## VI. The Principle of Cause and Effect

**"Every Cause has its Effect; every Effect has its Cause; everything happens according to Law; Chance is but a name for Law not recognized."**

Nothing happens by accident. Every effect has a cause; every cause produces effects. What appears as coincidence is simply cause and effect whose connection we have not yet traced. The practical implication: we can influence our experience by becoming aware of what we are causally putting into motion.

**Astrological Application:** The natal chart shows the cause (birth moment pattern) whose effects unfold through life. Transits show the current causal energies available. But consciousness can work with these causes rather than being unconsciously subject to them.

**Gene Keys Application:** The shadows we carry are causal frequencies generating specific life experiences. The work of Gene Keys is precisely this: tracing effects back to their causal frequency, and choosing to shift the cause.

**Contemplation Invitation:** "What am I causally generating in this area? What cause would I need to embody to produce a different effect?"

---

## VII. The Principle of Gender

**"Gender is in everything; everything has its Masculine and Feminine Principles; Gender manifests on all planes."**

All of creation contains both generative and receptive aspects. The Masculine principle (directed, active, penetrating) and Feminine principle (receptive, nurturing, containing) are not about biological sex but about fundamental polarities in all creation. True power comes from integrating both.

**Astrological Application:** The signs alternate masculine/feminine (Yang/Yin) — Aries/Taurus, Gemini/Cancer, Leo/Virgo... The planets have traditional masculine/feminine associations. The entire chart is a map of gender principle integration.

**Human Design Application:** The body's left/right split in HD (Personality/Design) maps to masculine/feminine channels of expression. The definition pattern shows how these principles are combined in the individual.

**Contemplation Invitation:** "Where am I being called to embody the generative principle? Where to the receptive? Where have I over-identified with one to the exclusion of the other?"

## The Principles in Synthesis

The Seven Principles form a complete description of how consciousness works with matter:
1. **Mentalism** — the medium (consciousness)
2. **Correspondence** — the structure (as above/below)
3. **Vibration** — the quality (frequency)
4. **Polarity** — the spectrum (high/low expressions)
5. **Rhythm** — the timing (cycles and tides)
6. **Cause and Effect** — the mechanism (what generates what)
7. **Gender** — the dynamic (active and receptive principles)

Any placement, transit, or life challenge can be illuminated through any of these lenses.
