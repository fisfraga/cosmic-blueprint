      - Reactive Nature:: Dramatic - addicted to crisis and intensity, creating emotional chaos, unable to be at peace, stirring up drama
      - Further Description:: The 36th Shadow of **Turbulence** is about emotional instability and the inability to find inner peace. At this frequency, we are constantly __stirred up by emotions__, unable to find calm, living in a state of perpetual crisis. This Shadow manifests differently depending on whether you are repressive or reactive. The repressive side suppresses emotions completely. These people appear calm but are actually **emotionally shut down**. They have cut themselves off from feeling in order to escape the turbulence. The reactive side is addicted to crisis and drama. These people cannot tolerate peace and calm. They create emotional turbulence wherever they go. They are ^^addicted to intensity^^ and unconsciously stir up drama. The 36th Shadow creates a life of emotional chaos. We lurch from one crisis to another, never finding stability or peace. We are constantly reactive, constantly stirred up by whatever is happening. The 36th Shadow is rooted in deep **nervousness and insecurity**. We don't trust that we're okay, that life is okay, so we're constantly anxious and on edge. This nervousness keeps us in a state of perpetual turbulence. The programming partner of this Shadow is the 6th Shadow of Conflict. Together they create a pattern of emotional turbulence (36th) that inevitably leads to conflict (6th).

We get stuck in roles - the weak one, the sick one, the failure - and these roles become **self-fulfilling prophecies**. We cannot break free from the patterns established in childhood. The 37th Shadow is rooted in the experience of powerlessness in family. When we were young and actually powerless, we developed strategies for dealing with that powerlessness. These strategies made sense then but __keep us stuck__ now. The programming partner of this Shadow is the 40th Shadow of Exhaustion. Together they create a pattern of weakness (37th) that leads to exhaustion (40th). The way through this Shadow is to recognize your own power and to step out of the victim role, claiming your rightful place as an equal.

    - Expectation #shadow
      - Gene Key:: [[Gene Key 42#gene key]]
      - Key Expression:: Attached to outcomes, disappointed when reality doesn't match expectations, grasping
      - Repressive Nature:: No expectations - cutting off from desire to avoid disappointment, resigned to disappointment, cynical
      - Reactive Nature:: High expectations - constant disappointment, grasping for specific outcomes, unable to accept what is, demanding
      - Further Description:: The 42nd Shadow of **Expectation** is about being attached to specific outcomes and experiencing __chronic disappointment__ when reality doesn't match our expectations. This Shadow manifests differently depending on whether you are repressive or reactive. The repressive side tries to have no expectations at all. These people cut themselves off from desire to avoid disappointment. They are **resigned and cynical**, expecting nothing so they won't be disappointed. The reactive side has high expectations. These people are constantly disappointed because reality rarely matches their expectations. They are ^^grasping and demanding^^, unable to accept what actually is. The 42nd Shadow creates perpetual disappointment. We have ideas about how things should be, and reality rarely conforms to our ideas. This creates **constant frustration** and dissatisfaction. The 42nd Shadow is rooted in the belief that we know how things should be and that reality is wrong when it doesn't match our expectations. This creates suffering because reality simply __is what it is__, regardless of our expectations. The programming partner of this Shadow is the 32nd Shadow of Failure. Together they create a pattern of expectations (42nd) leading to sense of failure (32nd) when reality doesn't meet them. The way through this Shadow is to __hold preferences lightly__ rather than rigid expectations, to be open to how things actually unfold rather than demanding they unfold according to your plan.
