    - Awakening #siddhi
      - Gene Key:: [[Gene Key 51#gene key]]
      - Key Expression:: Thunder of giving, permanent mutation, end of evolution, collective awakening, pure consciousness
      - Further Description:: The 51st Siddhi of **Awakening** sweeps all requirements and systems aside, making everything simple and clear. For the 51st Siddhi there are only two states of consciousness - __awake and asleep__. Something unpredictable and without cause occurs before someone enters a siddhic state - something momentous that cannot be put into words. There may be sciences of awakening before awakening, but there are no sciences after awakening. The 51st Siddhi says that until you are awake, you are asleep, and there are no levels within awakening. All ordering of consciousness is absurd - it is simply done by people who are asleep grading the patterns of their sleep. Awakening does make you different in terms of your physical genetic vehicle and its functioning. The 51st Siddhi is beyond spiritual jargon and systems, having a language of its own that is simple and shocking. Awakening is such a delicate evolutionary process, not the result of individual effort but a spontaneous evolutionary leap made possible by wider evolutionary forces operating throughout the universe. True awakening simply sees through everything and has nothing whatsoever to do with behaviour or experience. Neither does awakening come and go - when it comes, it stays forever. The 51st Siddhi is the ground beneath every one of the 64 Siddhis, and no one can attain these states without true awakening. In words, awakening is the ^^permanent dissolving of the separate self^^ and occurs through a physical mutation within the body. No amount of meditation or spiritual practice can bring about this mutation. Awakening occurs to someone who is so much themselves that it simply has no choice but to occur. The awakened one becomes a vessel that knows only how to give of itself, there being no friction preventing life from flowing through. This giving is love, but it may or may not manifest as affectionate love - in truth, it is **cosmic universal love**. The 51st Siddhi also operates at a far wider level than the individual. As an aspect of the Ring of Humanity, this Gene Key ensures that one day all of humanity will awaken. In times to come this Siddhi will begin to awaken entire gene pools. There will come a time when relationships will awaken, then families, then entire communities until finally the thunder will be heard throughout the human genome. When humanity awakens, it will move beyond time. That single moment when humanity opens its true eyes for the first time will be the __greatest single event in the history of awareness itself__.
  - Gift::
    - Initiative #gift
      - Gene Key:: [[Gene Key 51#gene key]]
      - Key Expression:: Creative independence, stirring good fortune, competitive spirit, first to do things, path of heart
      - Further Description:: The 51st Gift of **Initiative** is engaged whenever the human competitive spirit is put into the service of creativity. This Gift contains the activation code for __individual empowerment__. To follow your initiative is to step off the beaten track and follow the dictates of your own inner being. There is no safety net when you follow your own destiny - it is a giant leap onto a path that no one else has ever travelled. The mass consciousness is both in awe and afraid of those who follow this path in life. The collective way is the way of security, but the way of the individual is mysterious and fraught with uncertainty. It is not possible for a human being to awaken without first stepping fully into their creative independence. Those who step through this portal are deliberately turning their backs on all who have come before them. They are closing the book on all previous teachings and wisdom and going out to discover their own individual truth rather than anyone else's. This is a mythic path, often seen as a journey into the underworld in which the traveller will confront many challenges and tests. The 51st Gift is the highest expression of the human competitive spirit. At this level you no longer compete with others but with yourself. Even in competition, you use others as ^^mirrors to reflect your own level of excellence^^ rather than pushing them down so you might rise higher. This Gift is about harnessing your difference from others rather than trying to beat someone else at their own game. When you are truly being yourself, you unlock the magical force of genius that belongs to you and no other. To take your own initiative is to disregard everything you have ever learned or heard. There is no other way than this towards true genius. This is a path through fear, and the fear cannot be sidestepped. Whatever your deepest fear is, you will meet it here in the 51st Gift, and you will transcend it. Creative initiative is the path of every human spirit. Every one of us must at some point in life leave the crowd and head off into the uncharted wilderness of our heart. The vitality and courage in initiative stirs powerful responses from the quantum field. The more you believe in yourself and act from this belief, the more life supports you. To overcome your own sense of unworthiness and step beyond competition is to embrace the magic of higher dimensions. Those who take the initiative engage the forces of **good fortune and synchronicity**. The 51st Gene Key will always reward your perseverance when you trust in your own heart - it will shock you with good fortune.
  - Shadow::
    - Agitation #shadow
      - Gene Key:: [[Gene Key 51#gene key]]
      - Key Expression:: Portal of fears, lack of trust, competitiveness, restless electrical energy, shocking events
      - Repressive Nature:: Cowardly - steadily losing hope in life, shutting down and turning inward, highly depressive with little enthusiasm, repression of powerful nature, fear ruling life, preferring self-pity over facing fear
      - Reactive Nature:: Hostile - result of fearless rage and deep futility, bringing outer shock into the world, no respect for human beings, drawn to competitive spheres, throwing self into dangerous situations, profound agitation projected onto others
      - Further Description:: The 51st Shadow of **Agitation** creates enormous disturbance and insecurity within human beings. Together with its programming partner the 57th Shadow of Unease, this Shadow creates a sense of agitation inside you at some level. The reason is quite simply because __life is beyond our control__. Unforeseen events will occur in your life that can radically change your destiny. At the Shadow frequency, the perceived randomness of life creates deep insecurity because of the underlying fear that something bad could happen at any moment. This insecurity is compounded through direct evidence as we witness it happening to people around us. Shocks are part of all human life, but at the Shadow level where fear reigns, the possibility and fear of shock continually unnerves us. The hallmark of all Shadow frequencies is a profound ^^lack of trust in life itself^^. Trust is something that is either felt within the cells of your body or not. Without trust, human beings stay in a state of agitation - we tend to be jumpy, nervous and stressed. Your frequency determines how you view shocks and how you handle them physically and emotionally when they come. The 51st Shadow devotes all its energy into trying to stave off the inevitable. It lives in denial of the ultimate shock - the fact of physical death, and in denying death it actually throttles life. Only one who has fully embraced the certainty of death is truly alive. The competitiveness of the 51st Shadow is about needing to be first, not to better yourself, but to feel superior to others. The human competitive spirit can be a very ugly thing at the Shadow frequency because it can so easily brush aside others in its relentless push towards the top. The 51st Gene Key as a genetic archetype represents a **portal**, and where this portal leads depends entirely upon the frequency you program into your genetics. There is tremendous energy within the agitated state. Without inner purpose or direction this can be dangerous. Agitation never leaves you alone but continually prompts you to do something to get some kind of reaction. The 51st Shadow impacts the collective through highly unusual and often dangerous individuals who are agents of shock in the world, deepening mass consciousness fear that nowhere and nothing is safe.

    - Stillness #siddhi
      - Gene Key:: [[Gene Key 52#gene key]]
      - Key Expression:: Stilling of the wave, spaceless space, black hole, still-point of existence, transcending frequency
      - Further Description:: The 52nd Siddhi of **Stillness** helps us understand the concept of transcending frequency. Paradoxically, both ends of the spectrum lead to the same state - at both extremes we experience stillness. Energy waves oscillating at lower and lower frequencies would eventually stop altogether and you would experience nothingness. At the other end, energy waves vibrating at higher and higher frequencies eventually become so close together that they merge to create another kind of nothingness. This nothingness represents the siddhic state. When a being attains realization through the 52nd Siddhi, some intriguing things occur. Since all frequency and energy patterns are experienced as stopping, you find yourself sitting at the __heart of all creation__. All phenomena are experienced as wheeling around you as you become the still-point of existence itself. The incredible sheath of fear and stress created by the world aura can no longer touch you since you occupy a space outside of all vibration. This is why mystics use terms such as the **spaceless space** to describe this state. Along with the stillness comes the experience of the 58th Siddhi of Bliss, the programming partner of the 52nd Siddhi. These two great Siddhis mirror one of the great universal concepts of geometry and physics - the torus. At one end is the black hole, representing the yin pole that sucks, contracts and enfolds all energy and matter into itself. At the other end is the white hole, representing the yang pole that releases, creates and expands all energy and matter outwards to create space-time itself. Within human DNA, the torus at the heart of all being is directly experienced through the state of enlightenment, which unites ^^stillness (the black hole) with bliss (the white hole)^^. This experience of utter stillness and bliss is derived from higher functioning of your genetics. At the siddhic level of frequency, the body actually creates hormones and neurotransmitters that are extremely rarefied. Every Siddhi has its unique glandular secretion, and in the case of the 52nd Siddhi, a hormone is secreted which induces bliss and stillness throughout the body. The 52nd Siddhi contains within itself the power to focus humanity into a single unified pattern. It emanates a collective energy field that will eventually pacify the human emotional system. The aura of a single being manifesting this 52nd Siddhi will literally stop the thoughts of everyone in their vicinity. This kind of influx of Stillness into our planetary aura will make it possible for many millions of people to follow their right destiny into far wider service of the whole.
  - Gift::
    - Restraint #gift
      - Gene Key:: [[Gene Key 52#gene key]]
      - Key Expression:: Ecological torque, patience, non-interference, seed of destiny, power of pausing
      - Further Description:: The 52nd Gift of **Restraint** contains a secret of ecology. All true endeavors require a profound understanding of restraint, a phenomenon natural to all living systems. If a system is to last, it must learn to feed itself whilst it grows. However, for a system to be really successful it must have one vital factor right at its core from the beginning - it must __serve more than just itself__. The 52nd Gift requires a great deal of patience and an understanding that everything in nature moves at its own speed. Particularly in the beginning, things appear to move slowly. The moment we try to rush an idea, we disturb the ground in which it is sown. The more selfless your intention, the more power it will have. To begin anything, you must first have a clear intention. The intention is the seed, and the seed contains all the necessary ingredients and properties that will be needed in the journey ahead. The seed even contains the specific fragrances that will attract the right allies at the right times. The greater the power, the longer it takes to germinate. Every human being alive contains this intention - it is the **seed of your individual destiny**. To get your intention clear, you must ask yourself "How can I be of the greatest service to humanity?" Then you must live the answer. This is the power of Restraint - to allow your life to unfold without urgent demand. Only if you lose touch with your innermost core can you be truly stuck. As long as you remain in touch with the seed of your true intention, you may experience an outer pause, but you cannot be stuck. Ironically, it is during the moments of outer pause, when all energy seems to have come to a halt, that the ^^greatest growth occurs^^. The stored up energy and potential within a single human being is infinite in its proportions. This potential must be managed economically and allowed to grow and expand in an organic fashion. The Gift of Restraint is about non-interference. When you apply this to your own life, you have to accept yourself as part of a far greater flow than you can see. The acceptance of this restraint and its manifestation as patience is a truly powerful gift. It is through restraint that human power can be harnessed in a creative way. The 52nd Gift of Restraint stands out among the pressures in the Ring of Seeking as the only one keeping all this pressure in check. It is this Gene Key that actually generates the torque that allows all systems to gyrate and evolve.
  - Shadow::
    - Stress #shadow
      - Gene Key:: [[Gene Key 52#gene key]]
      - Key Expression:: Phenotype of fear, collective pressure, inability to keep still, flight or fight response, fear manifesting physically
      - Repressive Nature:: Stuck - physically, emotionally and mentally collapsed under pressure, never really getting off the ground, deep feeling of being stuck, depression and apathy, adrenal system can atrophy, only means of lifting free is finding way to serve others
      - Reactive Nature:: Restless - unable to sit still, trying to escape fear through activity, projecting frustration and anger onto others, over-stimulation of adrenal glands, burning themselves out in life, need to confront and embrace deep fear
      - Further Description:: The 52nd Shadow of **Stress** is responsible for one of the great phenomena of the modern world. Stress operates on many levels although its primary impact takes place on the physical plane, inside your body. This Shadow and its programming partner the 58th Shadow of Dissatisfaction represent the deepest genetic binary pattern that undermines human health, especially at a collective level. Stress is a __collective pressure and not a personal pressure__. It is an energy field generated by every human being alive, rather than being rooted in any specific personal issue. This means that stress is also deeply connected to our environment and to those around us. Billions of auras interlocking together form a great sheath that covers our world. This sheath or skin is what prevents human beings from seeing and experiencing the true unity of all consciousness. It is the construct known in the East as the maya - the great illusion. The frequency you are tuned to actually determines this environment, regardless of your physical geography. In the case of the 52nd Shadow, the collective or extended phenotype of humanity is shaped by fear, which creates an environment that puts the physical organism under great stress. The only way to escape this collective programming field is to rise above it at an energetic level. Stress is a state of physical pressure brought about through the lowering of your frequency. One of the key manifestations of stress is the inability to escape mental anxiety. What happens is that you give the mind the authority to make decisions that you hope will end the stress. However, this nearly always ends in disaster because the mind's activity is actually the ^^manifestation of the stress itself^^. This classic biofeedback loop reinforces the very state you are trying to escape. The 52nd Shadow is deeply connected with the function of your adrenal glands and the classic flight or fight response in human beings. The low frequency expression of the 52nd Shadow is rooted in the inability to keep yourself from reacting to fear. The fear driving this Gene Key can be so deeply embedded in the unconscious that you have no concept of it at all. Nonetheless, this fear pervades our environment and your reaction to it produces one of two responses - you either collapse or you run. As far as the 52nd Shadow is concerned, there are two types of people - those who cannot sit still and those who are stuck.

    - Superabundance #siddhi
      - Gene Key:: [[Gene Key 53#gene key]]
      - Key Expression:: End of evolution, endless beginnings, consciousness never changes, emptiness, beyond expansion
      - Further Description:: The 53rd Siddhi of **Superabundance** has given rise to one of the greatest misunderstandings in the history of spirituality - that of rebirth and karma. The great truth that comes through this Siddhi is that life consists of __endless beginnings but no endings__. This is the true meaning of Superabundance. Life goes on creating new forms whose actions determine the nature and destiny of future forms. There is no continuity between the forms themselves other than the genetic mechanism creating them. What continues, and what is superabundant, is consciousness itself as it endlessly penetrates the collective and writes the story of evolution. At the siddhic level your identification with your body, destiny and self totally dissolves, leaving you in a mystical state of pure emptiness and availability. Superabundance in many ways is closer to the concept of emptiness. It is a place where there is no further expansion because there is no evolution. If you are identified with the form of the world, you are identified with change, because all life is programmed to evolve. To one who has awakened through the eyes of the 53rd Siddhi, humankind is both a being and a becoming. The form endlessly evolves and expands, but the ^^consciousness never changes^^. We humans have made a basic error - we have identified with the instrument of our awareness, which expands according to the laws of evolution. Even though awareness may expand, consciousness does not and cannot expand since it is already everywhere and everything and even everywhen. This is the crucial truth to understand. Beneath the form, consciousness never changes or evolves or expands or contracts. It simply is. Superabundance refers to the concept beyond abundance - a space in which life is witnessed impassively by life. At the Gift level one rides the currents of evolution, which is always exciting. At the siddhic level however, all excitement and all responsibility are gone. There is no longer an edge since all is experienced as a game in time and space. People born into the 53rd Siddhi kill beginnings, or they kill endings. Whichever way you look at it, they bring an end to the paradox of human cycles. Superabundance is a space beyond frequency at which there is nothing left to do in the world. The 53rd Siddhi represents the state beyond and behind awareness known as **pure consciousness**. Consciousness in action manifests as expansion and evolution whereas consciousness at rest is the true underlying nature of everything. At this final stage, the stage known as realization or enlightenment, the great and final leap occurs - it is the shocking leap into pure consciousness and the end of evolution itself.
  - Gift::
    - Expansion #gift
      - Gene Key:: [[Gene Key 53#gene key]]
      - Key Expression:: Transcending and including, simplicity theory, bhakti energy, fractal growth, evolutionary impulse
      - Further Description:: The 53rd Gift of **Expansion** concerns human organizations and evolution. This Gift contains the seed that will one day bring all human beings into perfect organizational unity. For now, this Gift concerns our own trust in life. To begin anything, you must first have a clear intention. The more selfless your intention, the more power it will have. The intention is the seed, and the seed contains all the necessary ingredients and properties needed in the journey ahead. True expansion always involves __evolution__. Your endeavors regularly outgrow their own forms, just as life regularly outgrows the forms that it inhabits. In the business world, there are organizations that simply expand and there are organizations that expand and evolve. Over-expansion in business is a sign of Shadow consciousness at work. True expansion also embraces the notion of fractal growth. Fractal growth in business only occurs when the people within the business - who represent the consciousness of the organization - also evolve. True growth expands beyond its comfort zone, continually transcending its last level. When this is allowed to happen, the business grows in many directions simultaneously rather than in a single direction. The 53rd Gift has a particularly important role to play in the world of commerce by providing the competitive drive within organizations. Evolution follows what modern science terms Complexity Theory. However, just because systems appear complex to the mind does not mean they become less efficient. Evolution demands that systems become more efficient and efficiency is based on ^^simplicity rather than complexity^^. Synthesis only appears to be complex when you remain stuck at a low level of frequency and try to understand it intellectually. The Gift of Expansion demands that individuals transcend their personal opinions, views and attempts to understand what is going on. It takes enormous trust to allow your life to truly expand because it appears to the mind to become more complex, whereas in fact it is moving into greater and greater synthesis. Expansion is a process of transcending and including. The wonder of expansion is that each new level of integration is built upon the levels that came before, which are thus included in the synthesis itself. In a human being, the expansion of frequency can only occur in one way - through the heart. This 53rd Gift can be beautifully explained through the Indian concept of **bhakti or devotional energy**. This bhakti at the heart of evolution is continually outgrowing its own forms. The Gift frequency gives rise to the beginning of the transcendence of the mind. As you allow your awareness to expand, it opens your heart. The secret to this 53rd Gift is thus to give way to the bhakti - the ever-expanding-transcending-and-including energy of life itself. It requires that you allow yourself to be swept aside by life, letting go of all definitions of who you are and where you think you are going. Once you make this shift into your heart, you will find your life to be much simpler. You activate the frequencies of real prosperity by aligning yourself with the universal evolutionary impulse.
  - Shadow::
    - Immaturity #shadow
      - Gene Key:: [[Gene Key 53#gene key]]
      - Key Expression:: False cult of individual, fear at source, unsustainable growth, greed-driven expansion, collective immaturity
      - Repressive Nature:: Solemn - incredible vital energy to begin new things is repressed, becoming fixed into single activity for whole life, deep sadness as though might implode, enormous pressure to be serious, find it near impossible to embrace new things, end lives with great sorrow
      - Reactive Nature:: Fickle - never sitting still long enough to evolve, moving from one thing to next without following through, beginning new things without commitment, escaping greatest fear of being trapped, lives may look exciting but lack real depth or fulfillment
      - Further Description:: The 53rd Shadow of **Immaturity** concerns the energy inherent in all beginnings. Before you begin anything new in your life you need to ask yourself "What is the true essence of this beginning?" The majority of people don't realize that most beginnings contain subtle traces of fear. If these grains of fear are present at the very source of your endeavor, you will have unwittingly planted the seeds of its eventual demise. At the shadow frequency, __fear is an inner yoke__ inextricably bound to human intention. No matter how much work you put into something, if the arrow is bent it will never quite hit the mark you were intending. Immaturity is really nothing more than the human tendency to keep loading bent arrows into your bow. Since the 53rd Shadow is so closely linked to its programming partner the 54th Shadow of Greed, the most common expression of immaturity often involves power and money. In the world of commerce we find fear to be at the root of almost all businesses, even those that claim to be service-based. In human business at the Shadow frequency, growth is praised above all else, even though too much growth is unsustainable and damaging to the environment. Because of this fear reflex within us, we cannot comprehend the great laws of nature, the prime law being that of abundance. As one of six internal pressures forming the Codon Ring of Seeking, the 53rd Gene Key is responsible for creating a great deal of stress at the Shadow frequency. The stress it causes in our modern world is directly reflected in the desire to become materially rich. Great individual wealth is unsustainable unless you have a higher purpose that requires it. Keep in mind that there is a vast difference between prosperity and wealth. Wealth is a stockpiling of money based upon fear and greed, whereas ^^prosperity is a flow^^ that expands and contracts with universal rhythms. The Shadow of Immaturity is rooted in the human tendency to see ourselves as separate from nature. The human mind has enormous difficulty seeing itself as a collective organism deeply embedded in nature and the earth. This is what immaturity is - an aspect of the whole that does not yet realize that it is the whole. Humanity as a species must eventually grow out of our self-obsession and reach maturity. Just like a young child, humanity is an organism that is too self-obsessed to be aware of the consequences of its actions. We have created a great cult based on the individual, even though the **individual is itself an illusion**.

  - Siddhi::
    - Sanctity #siddhi
      - Gene Key:: [[Gene Key 61#gene key]]
      - Key Expression:: Entering the unknowable, inner truth, living mystery, divine vehicle, holiness essence
      - Further Description:: The 61st Siddhi of **Sanctity** is neither a place nor a state. It is the inner experience of sanctity - of being one with the Divine. Within this Siddhi, true reality dawns. The pressure that creates humanity's mass psychosis is no longer routed directly into the human brain but is refused and rerouted through the solar plexus system. Once the pressure of awareness is removed from the brain, the question of why finally ceases, and all other questions emerging from it such as how and who also die. However, the pressure must go somewhere and indeed it does. Through the medium of the solar plexus centre, it goes everywhere. It is through the constantly vibrating wave frequencies emerging from the solar plexus that awareness is carried beyond the body into __every corner of the universe__. You immediately find yourself both completely empty and yet endlessly full. The experience of Sanctity is paradoxically an experience with no experiencer and is one of the greatest mysteries of evolution. Once it has been entered it cannot end, and must be differentiated from all other mystical experiences or higher visionary states. A human being in whom the 61st Siddhi is being revealed is nothing but a human vehicle manifesting pure universal awareness. This state of Sanctity is the underlying nature of reality and until you come to rest within it, you are always asleep. For those of us outside of this realization, such a person seems to be a god. They ripple with divinity and exude the strange unearthly essence that humans refer to as **holiness**. They emit a frequency of such availability and at the same time such power that we find them either irresistible or terrifying. These are the people who we, in our psychosis, deify and worship. The whole point of such a presence among us is to demonstrate the fact of every human being's inner divinity. For one of us to settle into the realization of our inherent divinity all we need do is entertain another who has already realized this inner truth. The being within the 61st Siddhi no longer knows any difference between you and him or her. Because this state of consciousness has always existed and will always exist within every aspect of the universe, such a person cannot help you in any way. They simply serve as a ^^mirror of your own inherent divinity^^. The 61st Siddhi is about living life without answers. It is about simply becoming the mystery of who you are. Only when all answers finally fall away does the inner truth dawn. Life is a mystery. Enlightenment is a mystery. Inner truth is a mystery. No matter what you do to try to solve the mystery, you will never come closer. There is no attitude you can adopt in response to the mystery, since all such things are subtle attempts at solving it. You simply must come to realize that you know absolutely nothing, and this profound revelation can only occur in its own way and at its own time. The 61st Siddhi will become far more commonplace in the next few hundred years, because humanity is in the process of making a quantum leap. The children who will begin to arrive on this planet will carry this Siddhi of Sanctity in their bones. They will radiate it through every pore, and they will carry it out into the world with them. They will be the living embodiment of life's mystery - of life's potential in form.
  - Gift::
    - Inspiration #gift
      - Gene Key:: [[Gene Key 61#gene key]]
      - Key Expression:: God is pressure, creative path, destroying delusion, releasing trapped energy, loosen mental constructs
      - Further Description:: The 61st Gift of **Inspiration** is what happens when you stop worshiping God and start becoming God. Inspiration refers to a process that is very different from our normal understanding of the word. The word inspiration derives from the ancient Indo-European word for breath. The process of inspiration is a gradual releasing of your inner breath through the fabric of your reality and out into the world. Despite its wonderful creative manifestations in the world, inspiration involves a powerful __dismantling of the inner realities__ that have been built by your mind. Creativity is the single most important Gift for drawing humanity out of its mass psychosis. Inspiration begins when you place yourself directly in the firing line of the inner question that lies within each human being. The path of inspiration often begins as an outer quest as you seek answers from the outside world through systems, teachers or disciplines. In the beginning, inspiration comes to you sporadically as flashes, in which you fleetingly perceive the nature of reality in a distilled form. What separates inspiration from other heightened experiences is that after inspiration you are ^^permanently altered^^. Even a brief flash of true inspiration will change the way your awareness operates. Through inspiration you are being prepared for an even greater experience than you can yet conceive. The path through the 61st Gift is necessarily a very creative path, since true inspiration destroys some aspect of your inner delusion, thus releasing a great surge of trapped energy into your body and life. Such energy naturally seeks an outlet through creativity. Creativity unlocks the latent forces of inspiration inside you, pulling you away from a state of victimization. The main challenge for human beings with inspiration is patience. Inspiration cannot be forced or predicted, but comes when it comes and stays for as long as it stays. In between these heightened inspirational states, you may well become dejected or depressed. However, at a certain level of frequency you will reach a plateau, and at this level the inspiration itself gives you enough energy to maintain a heightened state. By its very nature the Gift of Inspiration is spiritual because it serves to loosen the hold of your mental constructs, opening and expanding your capacity for love. One of the hallmarks of the 61st Gift in action is the originality of its expression and the seemingly endless stream of its activity in the world. One of the greatest statements ever made concerning the nature of divinity is the mystical axiom "**God is pressure**." This revelation powerfully describes the process whereby the inner truth hidden within human beings is unlocked. Deep inside your body, the pressure of the mystery of your being beats in the heart of every single molecule of living DNA. Through its associated codon ring, the Ring of Gaia, this 61st Gene Key represents a mystery hiding inside every single unit of matter in the universe. This mystery is the mystery of Christ consciousness, that quintessence of inner light that holds all things together. It is the creative evolutionary process that gradually unveils this inner light.

Generally seen as a mental affliction rooted in chemistry, psychosis is associated with disorganized thinking and delusional beliefs. Perhaps its key hallmark is that the individual so affected is usually unaware of their affliction. However, what the 61st Shadow will show is that psychosis, which entails a __loss of contact with reality__, is the background consciousness of almost all human beings, including those that purport to understand the nature of the malady itself. Psychosis is in fact the ordinary state of the mass consciousness of humanity in the world today. In the 61st Shadow the true nature of the mind is obscured. The true nature of the mind is emptiness, or perhaps more clearly infinite space. However, the mind as we know it today is sick, and it is sick for one reason alone - because it seeks itself. It is through the narrow gate of the 61st Gene Key that a great question permeates the world of human beings, the question of **why**. This question is in fact an aberration caused by the limitations of our current awareness. There is a tremendous pressure within the human brain to find an answer to this question that continues to well up from the deepest reaches of our unconscious. Both right and left hemispheres of the brain grapple with an answer to this question but both are ultimately destined to fail. The right hemisphere seeks to end the pressure through religion whilst the left hemisphere seeks to end the pressure through science. Until humanity's final evolutionary leap takes place, we will remain in a state of psychosis. Our minds will continually drive us consciously or unconsciously to seek an answer to the question, or try to find release from the pressure behind the question. The arc of human evolution in modern times has been fueled by this question. As with all psychotic states, we are unaware of our own psychosis. The dilemma is that ^^you cannot fix the psychosis from within the psychosis^^. The ancient civilizations called this perceptive cloak thrown over the world the maya - the great illusion. The issue of the true nature of reality is all about frequency. Only when the frequency passing through your individual genetic coding rises to a sufficient level can you begin to perceive reality. At the frequency level of the mass consciousness of humanity today, the 61st Shadow prevails and humanity is simply a victim of the pressure of this Shadow. We will do anything and believe anything or anyone who promises to deliver us from the pressure. The other important aspect about doubt is that, although it is truly impersonal, we humans make it personal. The 61st Shadow holds a single great flaw, the flaw of **worship**. The moment you worship another, you set yourself below them in a victim position. You guarantee that your frequency will remain at that low level and be severely impaired.

      - Key Expression:: Cosmometry, language of perfection, death of ego, divine cosmometry, beyond reproach
      - Further Description:: The 62nd Siddhi of **Impeccability** is impossible to understand intellectually. As the 62nd Siddhi dawns, all sense of continuity in your normal life is broken. In the true siddhic state, all trace of your prior genetic condition is erased. Enlightenment is not only a spiritual and mystical event but also a chemical one, in that the very biochemistry of your body undergoes profound alterations. When you disappear into the siddhic state (and that is precisely how it happens), what is left behind is simply pure consciousness operating through a specific genetic vehicle. This is generally referred to as the __death of the ego__. Once consciousness ceases to identify itself as existing, the behaviour of the human vehicle is beyond the grasp of the intellect. Such behaviour is said to be impeccable. The word impeccable is often misunderstood when used in reference to true masters. The most common mistake we make is to believe that one who manifests the siddhic state must now behave in some kind of holy way. To be impeccable means to be exempt from doing sin. However, something profound needs to be understood here: one who has disappeared into the siddhic state has truly disappeared. There truly is no one at home. Pure consciousness is at play within this being, so whatever they say or do is ^^beyond reproach^^. This is the meaning of Impeccability. As we have seen through the 62nd Gift, communication at the more refined levels becomes very precise, especially through the medium of language. The 62nd Siddhi concerns the use of language at a level beyond our ken. Every single word has its frequency and vibration, and the order and syntax of your diction creates a certain aura. At the siddhic level, words do not come via the mind any more. They are not thoughts that become words. They emerge directly from the void, naked and pure. When someone manifests the 62nd Siddhi, they create an exact linguistic science of enlightenment. It is often amusing to note how closely related are the Shadow and the Siddhi. Thus, such people will use the intellect to defeat itself through pure logic. They will also use language to demonstrate how futile language actually is, for it is language and thought that underpin the very illusion of the human state in the first place. The 62nd Siddhi brings the understanding that every cell within the universe is a Divine word. This profound Truth allows such a being to become a master of Divine language. Because the Divine alphabet is so simple, a true master can respond to anything and anyone anywhere with **exact precision**. The science underlying all creation is sacred geometry. The eternal truths contained in sacred geometry unite all human sciences, arts and approaches to understanding through either the left or right brain. There is a Cosmometry behind life that choreographs all actions. The closer you come to full awakening, the more harmoniously your life flows with this cosmometry. When you finally merge into the ocean of consciousness you achieve complete oneness with the Divine Cosmometry. Everything you think, say or do is no longer done by you but by the whole. Therefore it is done impeccably. The real difference between the Siddhi and the Shadow is the complete absence of fear - which is the absence of self-identification. Divine Cosmometry is the language of perfection. It is the manifestation of impeccability in which your every movement and breath becomes an emanation of the pure light. Your whole being is simply made up of living, intelligent lines of force that move and flow without resistance. There is no longer anything out of place within your being. There is no longer any need, agenda or discomfort. All is exactly as it should be, in you and in everyone else. You have crossed the great divide in the throat and can never again return to the illusion of separation. You have entered into the language of light itself to see the one word in all words - the fathomless, the ineffable, the wordless - the impeccable beauty of being.
  - Gift::
    - Precision #gift
      - Gene Key:: [[Gene Key 62#gene key]]
      - Key Expression:: Greatest step, heart leads mind, intelligence strikes balance, divine language, breaking through
      - Further Description:: The 62nd Gift of **Precision** is far beyond the realm of the intellect, which is based on mere knowledge. As you start to awaken through the higher frequencies of this Gene Key, you either begin to question the world around you (the repressive nature) or you stop questioning everything (the reactive nature). Awakening is magical in its ability to bring about a natural balance within your being. In both cases, we are seeing the Gift of Precision being reborn. Precision happens when natural intelligence strikes a balance between the heart and the mind, but with one caveat - that the heart, the feminine principle, is given __control over life__. The masculine principle, the intellect, then moves into service of the feminine principle, which is about intuition, listening and receiving rather than thinking, expressing and transmitting. As the Gift of Precision grows stronger, it may seem as though the world gradually begins to come alive again. Intelligence recognizes intelligence, and with the mind out of the way the invisible essence that connects all beings is once again felt. Precision is what happens when intelligence is born. It's not simply about being precise and exact at an intellectual level, it's a completely new way of seeing life. Precision is inspirational and original (the 61st Gift is Inspiration), and such inspiration does not depend on your vocabulary. When the Gift of Precision describes something, it arranges facts in ways that are ^^inspirational and exciting^^ rather than dull and dry. As this Gift arises in a person, they begin to communicate with such economy and exactness that almost everything they say is beautiful, poignant and seamless. Such people soon develop keen gifts as communicators, speakers, writers, artists, actors or scientists. This Gift is designed to find the limelight. When the heart leads the way and uses logic to describe what it sees and feels, others cannot help but listen. The 62nd Gene Key is genetically coupled with the 31st Gene Key forming the codon known as the **Ring of No Return**. This mystical name describes the evolutionary process that takes place when higher consciousness reaches the throat centre in human beings. The throat centre is where the greatest human initiation occurs. Once the higher involutionary currents begin to use your voice to transmit their truths, you begin a process of detaching from your own identity. The 62nd Gene Key allows access to the universal language of light behind all forms. When the pitch of your frequency allows it, the words you speak and their emanations change and begin to serve a higher purpose. There is deep magic woven into language. It is why the origin of the word spell correlates with the idea of casting spells that have power over others. Every word has an inner spirit - a code of light that lends it an independent force in the cosmos. The moment a word or group of words is given voice, vibrations radiate out into the universe. There is no return. At the level of the 62nd Gift, your use of words becomes much more precise because you recognize this great truth. The 62nd Gift represents the true power behind the Gene Keys themselves. At first it gives you a private inner language that allows you to initiate a deep transformation of your Shadow consciousness. At a certain stage in your journey however, you will feel the call of this language within you and its urge to escape into the world through your voice. This is the beginning of your higher initiation - the leap from worship to embodiment.
  - Shadow::
    - Intellect #shadow
      - Gene Key:: [[Gene Key 62#gene key]]
      - Key Expression:: Stupidity of being clever, abuse through language, facts as treasure, split within humanity, mind reigns as king
      - Repressive Nature:: Obsessive - when Shadow turns inward it becomes obsession, focussing on small things as way to avoid feeling suffering, becomes lost in mundane world with little creative outlet, at lowest end can become mentally ill, held prisoner by minds rather than by details themselves
      - Reactive Nature:: Pedantic - use intellect to attack everything outside them to defend deep insecurity, entirely in grip of intellect which questions everything endlessly, delights in finding obscure details and facts that disprove and disempower others, utterly unable to switch off minds
      - Further Description:: The 62nd Shadow of **Intellect** is one of the 64 Shadows that may surprise people to see represented as a Shadow. Many people may be surprised to see the word intellect represented as one of the 64 Shadows. The language of the Gene Keys holds true at all levels of frequency, and unlike human languages it is not a language that can be learned and mastered via the intellect alone. To master the language of creation we have to embody it fully at every level, not just the intellectual level. In the context of the Gene Keys, intellect refers to the thinking capacity of the human mind, which bases all its suppositions on its two main objectives - the acquisition of facts, and the skill of manipulating those facts via language. Intellect is the skill of manipulating knowledge, but __knowledge is quite different from understanding__. Understanding does not simply refer to the activities of the mind but to the whole experiential being. You can be a dunce at the intellectual level, but can still understand many profound truths within the heart of your being. Likewise, intelligence has nothing to do with intellect. Generally speaking, the more intellectual you are, the less intelligence you use. In the context of the Gene Key language, intelligence is something that occurs without the use of the mind, although intelligence may also use the mind as a means to transmit itself. The modern world that we inhabit is truly upside down. Our very schooling is designed to make us more intellectual and less intelligent. We are already intelligent as children. Your natural intelligence is to be found in the way you move your limbs, in the brightness of your eyes and in the freedom of your self-expression. It is the reservoir of your future genius. But that genius is very efficiently curtailed from the moment you enter school. The more information you put into your head, the more sedated you become. Like any of the human Shadows, the 62nd Shadow of Intellect is not inherently bad. Intellect is a wonderful quality if it is used correctly in the service of innate intelligence. But when intellect is put in charge of the planet, as it currently is, then intelligence cannot be seen except in the few people who have raised this Gene Key to a higher frequency. **Intelligence is of the heart, whereas intellect is of the mind.** This is the core sentence. The 62nd Shadow is obsessed with facts, and facts are born of language and names. Without a name, you cannot create a fact. Names and language in their turn create the software of the human mind. Without this software the mind is silent. In a world where facts are regarded as treasure, the mind reigns as king. Our world is divided between the 62nd Shadow of Intellect and its programming partner, the 61st Shadow of Psychosis. The pairing of the 62nd Shadow and the 61st Shadow reflects a fundamental split within humanity itself. Through the 62nd Shadow man tries to solve the mysteries of life through his intellect - in other words, through science. Meanwhile, through the 61st Shadow he tries to solve the same mysteries without his mind - through religion. These two poles, which at their extremes become scientific intellectualism and religious fanaticism, are genetic subprogrammes that keep humanity operating at a low frequency level. The 62nd Shadow really represents ^^abuse through language^^. It is not we who abuse language, but language that abuses us. Language relies upon our frequency. At low frequencies, it completely takes control of our reality.

  - Siddhi::
    - Truth #siddhi
      - Gene Key:: [[Gene Key 63#gene key]]
      - Key Expression:: Truth is every step, doubt is truth, eternal moment, everywhere and everything, ultimate relaxation
      - Further Description:: The 63rd Siddhi of **Truth** contains the ultimate paradox. The Gift of Inquiry, symbolized by the path of yoga, has a deep shock in store for those who are drawn to it. In the original Chinese I Ching, the two hexagrams corresponding to the 63rd and 64th Gene Keys have very revealing names. The 63rd is called After Completion and the 64th is called Before Completion. No matter how elevated a person's awareness becomes or how advanced their yogic discipline is, until they reach this siddhic realm they will never realize the ultimate paradox that is Truth. The only way to arrive at such a state is to reach a position of inner surrender. After all your efforts and exertions to find Truth, you must eventually become one with your own doubt. This is the shock of the 63rd Siddhi - that __doubt is Truth__. This is a deep let down for your questing spirit. It is the ultimate state of failure and dejection. If logic is allowed free reign, it will always cancel out logic and conquer itself. In this sense all yoga can only ever lead to tantra. The more logic is followed, the more mysterious and poetic it seems to become - until it reaches the impasse that logic cannot move beyond. Logic and its human counterpart doubt are designed to self-destruct, taking you the observer with them. When doubt is trusted at such a profound level, the doubter disappears into the doubt, leaving Truth. However, there is no sequential process to this - Truth is there all along within the doubt. It is simply waiting to be realized, like a pearl within an oyster. It needn't be prised out, but simply recognized. Truth is realized in many different ways. The other side of this Siddhi is the 64th Siddhi of Illumination, which arrives at the same conclusion in a totally different way - through the poetics of randomness. The yogic path to Truth is a beautifully clipped garden in comparison to the wild jungles of the 64th Siddhi. The 63rd Shadow of Doubt is the path of eventual exhaustion. Like the Buddha, you must study, discipline yourself, climb and exert yourself to get to the top, only to realize that the answer was there all along, even before you began. The Siddhi of Truth is everywhere. There is nothing that is not Truth. Whatever happens to you, whatever you feel in every moment, however delirious or disturbing, it is nothing but Truth. Truth is all there is. At the Shadow frequency there is nothing but Truth, at the Gift frequency there is nothing but Truth. ^^Truth is every step of the way^^. This realization that everything is Truth is well represented by the I Ching name After Completion. The realization of Truth involves a complete relaxation of your entire being. The quest is at an end because the quest has deleted the questioner. The doubter has entered into the question so fully that the question has swallowed his or her awareness. All paths to Truth are therefore a complete fabrication, all techniques only distractions and all systems and concepts are ultimately worthless. These are unhappy words for the seeker, who still remains identified with his or her search, but even that is Truth. There is no such thing as distorted Truth or hidden Truth. Truth is simply here now, in every moment, at every stage of your life. It is **eternal, undying, pure, incorruptible** and so beautifully simple. Truth really is the most precious and beautiful of the Siddhis in its human expression because of its vast, vast relaxedness. It is like resting under a tree on a warm balmy evening after walking all day long. Whenever you give yourself rest from worrying, you are treading around the fringes of remembering Truth. Whenever you smile or breathe a deep sigh, there you are coming closer to Truth. Whenever your face loses its hard edges and becomes softer, there Truth is being remembered. Truth is your natural state - your simple state, without complexity or concern. It is a drifting space, a total sinking into your being. Truth has no need of meaning and no concern for or possibility of an answer. In a single sentence, Truth is the eternal moment of the universe.
  - Gift::
    - Inquiry #gift
      - Gene Key:: [[Gene Key 63#gene key]]
      - Key Expression:: Ladder of self inquiry, yoga path, harnessing doubt, progression through levels, inner quest
      - Further Description:: The 63rd Gift of **Inquiry** emerges when the energy of doubt is harnessed cleanly. Inquiry is about remaining open without finding a definitive answer to life. All pure Inquiry is of great service to humanity. It inevitably unlocks many of nature's secrets by examining life in minute detail. The real purpose of doubt is to serve the higher good in an __impersonal way__. If someone has a deep genetic tendency to doubt or ask questions, they can greatly improve the quality of their life and relationships by channeling that doubt away from their personal life and pressing it into service. The 63rd Gift is about progression through levels and stages. This is the way in which logical understanding works. The continual pressure of doubt fuels the spirit of inquiry, which leads to deeper and deeper levels of understanding. However, the more deeply you inquire into anything, the more complex it becomes. You have to take it apart piece by piece, whether it is a scientific theory or an internal combustion engine. What is of prime importance is what you learn through the process. As you slowly ascend the ladder of frequencies, the nature of your inquiry changes. You may begin by inquiring into some aspect of the world around you. There is one golden rule with the 63rd Gift of Inquiry - if you inquire deeply enough into anything, you will arrive at the revelation that you, the observer, are intricately bound with that which you observe. This discovery actually heralds the beginning of the end of the logical approach, since it signifies the end of your ability to assess life objectively. At higher levels of frequency, you begin to enter the holistic domain of synthesis in which all phenomena are increasingly seen to affect each other. This new quantum world thus forces your inquiry into a far more subjective territory - that of your ^^inner self^^. At a certain stage, the Gift of Inquiry must always lead you back into yourself. The 63rd Gene Key is one of four Gene Keys that make up a genetic grouping in your DNA known as the **Ring of Divinity**. Because of its connection to the all-important 22nd Gene Key, this codon ring has much to do with the transformation of human awareness through suffering. The 63rd Gene Key plays a central role in this theme because it is your Divine doubt that drives you to follow a spiritual path in the first place. The deep discomfort of not remembering your true nature becomes more and more evident the more profoundly you inquire into your own nature. When you begin earnestly and honestly to question your own nature and purpose, you enter one of the great spiritual paths of all time, known in the East as the path of yoga. Yoga is essentially a progressive path of refining your physical and spiritual essence to such a height that you arrive at liberation or spiritual realization. What is common to all systems of yoga is the progressive sequential process whereby you raise the frequency of your vibration from a low state to a higher state. It is the Gift of Inquiry that urges you to understand all the states along the way. These two genetic programming partners, the 63rd and 64th Gene Keys, represent the paths of yoga and tantra respectively. Whereas tantra is a path based on acceptance of what is, yoga is the path of doubt because it harnesses the great human spirit of inquiry.
  - Shadow::
    - Doubt #shadow
      - Gene Key:: [[Gene Key 63#gene key]]
      - Key Expression:: Paradoxical power of doubt, pressure of why, logic meets paradox, question cannot be answered, psychosis
      - Repressive Nature:: Self-Doubt - when doubt is repressed it plagues as self-doubt, based upon comparison, hiding from own question because it terrifies, giving up rooted in childhood conditioning, going traditional route through education, religion or science, inwardly remaining unfulfilled and restless
      - Reactive Nature:: Suspicion - externally projected into world, rooted in self-doubt but transformed into anger and taken out on others, projecting doubts onto those closest to us, making doubts personal embarks on wave of destruction, biofeedback loop common to many relationships
      - Further Description:: The 63rd Shadow of **Doubt** represents a huge question mark literally wired into the human brain. Your logical left brain is designed to see things in terms of repeating patterns and this ability has been a key ingredient in human evolution. As the cognitive functioning in our brains developed, early human beings began to teach themselves more and more effective skills to ensure their survival. Today we have become so efficient in the use of our tools that we can even read the logical patterns wired into our very DNA. Doubt can therefore be a very positive force in driving evolution forward. However, the problem with doubt is that __it does not go away__. Doubt sits there deep within the neurocircuitry of every human brain where it causes a huge unconscious pressure. When seen purely for what it is, doubt is simply the word we humans give to this constant mental pressure. Although this pressure behaves differently from one human to another, the one consistency is that it drives each of us to try to bring an end to the pressure. We humans cannot easily accept this never-ending feeling of being unsettled somewhere deep inside. For most of us, the need for mental certainty results in our taking on a firm set of beliefs or values that provide a barrier against the doubt inside our minds. Doubt is the beginning and end of the human journey. It leads to the Gift of Inquiry, which in turn leads to the discovery of the Siddhi of Truth, the final answer to all doubt. However, the journey through the levels of this 63rd Gift does not lead you in the direction you might expect. The final resolution of logic lies outside the domain of logic. Our conundrum is simply a matter of evolutionary circuitry - our brains have evolved to try to find release from the inner pressure. But in a sense, we have been conned by nature because there is no answer to our doubt. At the same time our attempts to end our mental anxiety have forced the brain to evolve even further. This is how our anxiety serves evolution. The other important aspect about doubt is that, although it is truly impersonal, we humans make it personal. If doubt serves genuine inquiry then it becomes creative, but if it becomes personal or is internalized, it becomes destructive. If you do not use your mind in a creative way, the pressure either becomes a projection onto someone or something outside or it collapses inward and becomes ^^self-doubt^^. Doubt belongs to the collective. Individuals need to understand that self-doubt is a low frequency conditioning field that pressures all human beings to evolve to a higher life of service to the totality. The beauty of logic is that it is itself a great paradox - it seeks an end to doubt but can never be satisfied in any single answer. The only satisfactory answer is one that defies logic. At the Shadow frequency, all the human mind wants is certainty, and if it cannot find it, it will manufacture it. The **human logical mind is simply not designed to be certain of anything other than paradox**. Anything less than paradox takes place within the Shadow frequency and must therefore be logically false.
