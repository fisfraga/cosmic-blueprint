    - **The Fire Eye**
      - Deep inside the arc of your being there is an eye. This eye was born when you were born, and it will die when you die. This is the Fire Eye. When you see the world through this eye, you see a world of adventure, of excitement, of passion. When you see through the Fire Eye, everything is vibrant and changing and bursting with potential – the very air around you crackles with the electricity of your longing. Through the Fire Eye, you live in the unpredictable and ever-changing landscape of dreams – one moment you are wandering carefree through the green valleys of comfort, and the next you are staggering hopelessly through the parched deserts of desire.
      - It is the Fire Eye inside you that has led you here. It is the seeker inside you, the inquirer, the believer, the knower. The Fire Eye leads you on a dance through life as you leap from one experience to another. It lures you across continents and carries you over the threshold of every relationship in your life.
      - The Fire Eye never ceases to dream of what once was, or of what may one day become. When you look out at life through the Fire Eye, you wonder about the purpose of your life. You may feel you could be doing more. You know you have so much to give but you don’t yet know how to give it. You feel a restless longing to accomplish something, to fulfill your highest destiny. The Fire Eye dreams large dreams. As the turbine that drives all human genius, the Fire Eye knows that anything in life is possible. It has already accomplished so much in our world. It is the Fire Eye that builds the great civilisations and puts men on the moon.
      - It is the Fire Eye that drives our human evolution. Those whose lives have unfolded through the Fire Eye have become our great heroes and heroines – those great statesmen, warriors, explorers, inventors and geniuses whose lives remain forever enshrined in our history.
      - As the energy of eternal youth inside you – the Fire Eye is wonderfully dynamic, endlessly hungry and always, always filled with hope. But for all its fertile vitality and raw power, the Fire Eye has a flaw. It is self-obsessed.
      - The Fire Eye cannot see beyond its own need for satiation. Like a wild dog chasing its own tail, it does not know how to rest. No matter how great are its achievements in the world; the Fire Eye is not capable of finding inner peace.
    - **The Water Eye**
      - Deep inside the arc of your being there is another eye. This eye was present before you were born and it will remain after you die. This is the Water Eye. When you see the world through this eye, you see only that which is before you. When you see through the Water Eye, your primary awareness rests with your breath, your body and its gentle rhythms, and with the movement of life all around you. When you see through the Water Eye, all of life sees with you, and all of life comes towards you. Through the lens of the Water Eye, all is still, all is quiet and all is fathomless.
      - Perhaps it is the Water Eye that has led you here. If you are here because you do not know, then you may be in for a gentle surprise.
      - The Water Eye has no interest in achievement or knowledge or dreams. It has no interest in purpose or fulflment or change. The Water Eye has no interest in human experience. Rare is the human being who can give their life over to the Water Eye. It is the subtlest of the subtle. It is the softest, most paradoxical, most mysterious presence inside you. The Water Eye is a power without force, without emotion, without warmth. If you allow the lens of the Water Eye to open inside your being, you will begin to view your life and the world in a completely new way.
      - In the outer world, the Water Eye has built nothing. There is nothing impressive about it. It passes unnoticed. Those whose lives have unfolded through the Water Eye have generally been misunderstood and misrepresented. They did not discover it on purpose for it cannot be chased or hunted or sought.
      - Of all the mysteries in the universe, the Water Eye alone brings inner peace. But for all its allure and wonder, nothing you do in life will lead to its opening.
      - **_The Water Eye responds to one thing and one thing alone. It responds to the one who yields._**
    - **Putting The Fire Beneath The Water**
      - If you have been drawn to the Gene Keys, then you may already know that it is based upon the ancient code of the Chinese I Ching – the Book of Changes. This deeply mysterious book continues to circle the world in many diverse forms. Its most common use is as an oracle – a tool to give subtle guidance in any given life situation. In essence, the I Ching is designed to attune you to the presence of that subtlest inner wisdom – the Water Eye within you.
      - The ancient Chinese had their own words for the Fire Eye and the Water Eye. They called them the Hsin and the Yi respectively. When used over time, the correct use of the I Ching is a spiritual path in itself. It will guide you to listen to your innate, silent, intuitive wisdom – your ‘Yi’ (the Water Eye) above and beyond your human desires and longings – your ‘Hsin’ (the Fire Eye). Unfortunately, our modern global lifestyle is so strongly developed around the Fire Eye, that even the I Ching has now mostly become another toy for that restless longing inside us. We no longer realise the level of commitment that the I Ching requires of its students. Like most sacred and magical texts, it has now been taken far away from its original context, and its true secrets lie for the most part lost to modern humans.
      - This is where the Gene Keys come into play. The Gene Keys are a contemporary adaptation of the I Ching and the Golden Path provides a structured and disciplined means of contemplation on the teachings themselves. The Golden Path allows you to take the Gene Keys deeply into your daily life. It is designed to be contemplated over a period of time so that you can absorb its insights and experience its transformational power.
      - The advantage of this form is that you do not have to change very much externally in your life. You adjust the teachings to your daily rhythms, rather than the other way around. As your contemplation deepens over time, the living wisdom within you begins to awaken at a new level, leading to unexpected changes and new vistas opening up before you. This is a process referred to as Self Illumination.
      - As you contemplate your Golden Path it will act as a reminder to yield to life. It will consistently nudge you to listen to the subtle wisdom of the Water Eye within, and it will compassionately assist you to transform the many challenges that come from listening only to the Fire Eye – your emotions and desires. The potential of the Golden Path is to remind you of the secret of alchemy – to put the fire beneath the water.
      - This is a gradual process of coming into equilibrium, in which many hidden gifts inside you may come to the surface. Ultimately the Golden Path is a rich inner voyage into the deep mystery of the Self. Because it is a mystery, there is no way of predicting what may occur in your life as a result of following this path. The only way to find out is to step forward bravely, trusting in the inner light that already lies inside you.

    - **The Golden Path and the Art of Contemplation**
      - The central technique that underpins the entire spectrum of the Gene Keys teachings is contemplation. It is an important term to clarify as it already carries different meanings within different languages and cultures. In the introduction to the Gene Keys book, the three classic paths to truth are outlined. They are called meditation, concentration and contemplation. Since contemplation is a blend of the other two it is important to fully understand their relationship, and you are invited to suspend any previous understanding you may have concerning these words.
      - **Meditation**
        - When we refer here to meditation, we are referring to more than just a technique. Meditation is a fundamental path leading towards enlightened spiritual understanding. Meditation is the great feminine or ‘yin’ path and is primarily involved with the ‘right brain’ approach to life, which is holistic rather than reductionist. Meditation is well exemplified in the Buddhist tradition by the word ‘vipassana’ which can be translated as deep-seeing. This kind of meditation is based on watching, waiting, listening, witnessing and allowing. This also correlates with the ancient spirit of ‘tantra’, which is based upon an all-embracing view of the universe.
        - From the perspective of the Gene Keys, meditation is a path in which you simply go along with whatever is emerging in your life. You do not in any way resist your nature. This is beautifully caught by the Advaita Vedanta tradition, in which everything is viewed as perfect the way it is.
        - Even if you forget, it’s still perfect. If you are angry, impatient, mean or any other negative state, it is part of the emerging perfection of the totality. To use the simple metaphor of life as a river, in meditation your awareness is just sitting quietly beside the river. You just sit there watching life go by, and slowly, over time, as you watch life without judgement (or even with judgement) an inner core begins to become aware of itself inside you. As this core emerges you are able to let go even more of trying to control things and follow life. This is the path of effortlessness and deep trust.Watching the river go by
      - **Concentration**
        - Concentration lies at the opposite end of the spectrum from meditation. Concentration is the Yang path or the path of effort. This path is rooted in the left hemisphere of the brain – the logical brain that sees consciousness as a process of questing that can be fulfilled in stages over time. Concentration correlates to yoga, in the widest use of the word. Yoga begins with the premise that somehow you’ve fallen out of union. So you take on this yoga and you begin to work to bring yourself back to union. You set off on a journey to recover your true nature.
        - Effort is needed in the path of concentration. In the West it has always been a strong path – exemplified in the path of prayer – the path of heading back towards God. An Eastern example of this approach is Zen. In Zen, especially the Rinzai version of Zen, you sit and concentrate your mind and your full being on a koan, a paradox. Finally through that concentration, which may take years and years of effort, you break through and see the true nature of reality. There are many types of yoga – karma yoga, bhakti yoga, mantra yoga – and they all move towards the same truth – they are all efforts moving towards truth. This is what is meant by concentration.One pointed Inquiry
      - **Contemplation**
        - Contemplation is the no-hand path. It borrows elements from both meditation and concentration. In some respects contemplation is a forgotten path. Of all the world teachings, the one most related to the essence of contemplation is the Tao. Because it is less easy to define than meditation and concentration, it sometimes seems a more nebulous path, and this is its one disadvantage.
        - However, when it is correctly understood and practiced, it is a less extreme path than the other two and is particularly suited to our practical, everyday lives.
        - Contemplation uses the sustained pressure of concentration in order to create the conditions for a breakthrough to occur. However, contemplation is a gentler approach than concentration and it doesn’t push too hard in any direction. It presupposes that breakthrough can only occur in a state of relaxation and play. There is a well-known story about the Buddha overhearing a musician. The man said that if you tighten the string of your instrument too far, it will snag, but if you have it too slack it will not play music. Out of this insight the ‘Middle Way’ was born. Like the Middle Way, contemplation is a dance with the opposites. It uses sustained pressure in a playful way and this also makes it a less formal path than concentration or meditation.
        - In the introduction to the Gene Keys, there is a metaphor for the spirit of contemplation. It describes a small ring case such as you might find at an expensive jewelers. The case is covered in sumptuous velvet, and somewhere inside a thing of mysterious beauty lies hidden. Amid the countless folds of velvet is a tiny hidden catch. You take the case in your hands and you roll it gently through your fingers. You don’t know what you are looking for but you just enjoy the feel of the soft velvet while you allow your fingers to explore the case. At a certain point, you find the hidden catch and all of a sudden the case springs open to reveal the treasure. Contemplation is such a search. It is not an intense search, rather it is a playful appreciation of mystery, content to enjoy the journey itself as much as the breakthroughs along the way.
        - The key in contemplation is to have an object to Contemplate. You need an object with enough dimensions to sustain your practise. This is what the Gene Keys are designed for.
        - To some, contemplation may sound like a mental word, and at one level it is. We do use our minds to consider the mysteries of the inner dimensions. But we also use other aspects of our being at the same time. Contemplation is a trinary path. We contemplate mentally, emotionally and physically.
        - As you learn more about the different stages and sequences of the Golden Path you will see how these three levels of contemplation are interwoven.
        - Contemplation takes place on all levels
    - **The Art of Contemplation – Audio by Richard Rudd**
      - Link to Audio
    - **Modes of Contemplation**
      - **Spheres And Pathways** 
        - When you look at your Hologenetic Profile you will see that it is made up of a grid of circles or spheres, which are in turn connected by a series of pathways and arrows. Some people might notice a similarity here between the ancient teachings of the Jewish Kabbalah. As a new synthesis, the Gene Keys stands on the shoulders of many of the great systems of the past, and by combining them it seeks to present an even deeper view of reality.
        - Each of the 11 spheres of your Profile represents an aspect of your life on which you may contemplate. As you place your awareness on a particular sphere and its corresponding Gene Key, you will be opening up the potential for insight and transformation to occur in that realm. For example, as you contemplate the sphere of your Life’s Work, you may begin to understand aspects of your past in a new light. At the same time you may also begin to realise that you have a far greater potential for a new future than you have allowed yourself to believe. This change in the frequency of your beliefs is what makes the Gene Keys so powerful.
        - There are also eleven pathways that link the eleven spheres together in what appears to be a linear flow. These pathways represent the dynamic processes that underpin your destiny. At low levels of frequency, the inner light or life force inside you becomes choked in these channels and our natural evolution becomes stalled.
        - As your contemplation on each sphere deepens, you can experience striking periods of transformation or breakthrough as this inner light begins to flow once again through your life. This process of self-illumination takes time and requires sustained contemplation and patience. As your frequency becomes raised, you also begin to see how each sphere and pathway is part of a holographic whole.
        - For example, as you experience a shift in your mental beliefs, so you will see this reflected in your physical body and in your relationships
      - **Gene Keys And The 6 Lines** 
        - The 64 Gene Keys themselves are the programming language of inner consciousness. As you contemplate your own Gene Keys and even those that do not appear in your own Profile, you are directly imbibing the universal truth at the heart of these teachings. In addition to this, the story of each Gene Key is focussed through one of 6 possible lenses known as the 6 lines. The revelation of the 6 lines comes directly from the mathematical structure of the I Ching and its 64 Hexagrams. A hexagram is a symbol made up of 6 lines and each line adds a certain colour to the Gene Key. If you imagine that each Gene Key is like an individual melody in music, then the 6 lines would be like 6 different keys that those melodies could be played in. The same melody would sound very different in each key, so the importance of understanding the line together with the Gene Key cannot be underestimated.
        - As you learn to understand the timbre of each line, you will find it easier to apply them to the 64 Gene Keys. This means that there are 6 x 64 permutations of the Gene Keys, making 384 fascinating stories. Once you have mastered the lines in your own sequences, you will easily be able to apply them to the sequences of others. The inclusion of the 6 lines is one of the things that make contemplating the Gene Keys so special.
        - You have to release the power of your imagination coupled with your intuition as it works through the formula of the 6 lines. This can lead to surprising and uplifting insights. Contemplation on the Gene Keys and the 6 lines is an empowering process as it is something you learn to do yourself. It allows you a certain freedom to rove within the living text and explore its hidden capacities for awakening those secrets that lie hidden within.
    - **The Gene Keys Approach**
      - **A _path of gentle transformation_ **
      - The Gene Keys Approach invites us to develop our humility through embodying the four qualities that lie at the heart of the Gene Keys. Please consider these values as you navigate the Gene Keys Teachings.
        - **Contemplation – **taking full responsibility for one’s inner state, using everyday challenges for growth and transformation.
        - **Inquiry** – asking the profound introspective questions, inviting wisdom to come from within. Cultivating a state of calm presence in all situations.
        - **Gentleness** – nurturing a kind and gracious approach towards self and others. Encouraging a spirit of unwinding and un-learning, versus striving and fixing.
        - **Patience** – cultivating compassion, honesty and curiosity with an inherent trust in the underlying process.
  - Treading the Golden Path

        - URL:: https://genekeys.com/c/the-activation-sequence/lessons/introduction-to-the-gene-keys/topic/treading-the-golden-path/
    - **The Voyage**
      - The Golden Path is a path into the deep mystery. It is a path of soul, in which your daily living becomes your greatest muse. It is a path of enrichment, which at the same time trains a fierce eye upon the way you are living. It asks you to contemplate some profound and sometimes painful questions.
      - As you tread the Golden Path, you will take a deep dive into three primary questions:
        - **1. What is your purpose in life?**
        - **2. How fulfilling are your relationships?**
        - **3. How integrated are you into your community?**
      - When human beings are in harmony with creation, these three questions simply do not exist. In essence, the Golden Path describes the organic flow of life when it follows natural rhythms without resistance. There may have been times in human history when this was the case, but our modern world is very clearly not one of these times. This is the purpose of the Gene Keys – to assist individuals, relationships and communities in realigning their lives back into a wider harmony with creation itself.
      - In the original I Ching, the most common translation of the 10th Hexagram is the word ‘Treading’. In the Gene Keys, its equivalent, the 10th Gene Key, is the Gift of Naturalness. As we tread the paths of our lives, so we write our destinies. The further we move from our essential nature, the more we and those around us suffer. And this suffering is vital to us. It keeps reminding us of the simplest path, the path of least resistance, the path that is naturally ours. It has been said that the hardest and the easiest thing in the world is simply to be yourself.
      - The Buddha referred to this Golden Path as the Middle Way – the natural curve and slide of our inner evolution as it manifests in the outer world.
      - As we unravel the thread of our true destiny, so our natural path begins to shine before us and open beneath us. It becomes illuminated by our inner awareness, and in this sense, our lives become golden. Treading the Golden Path is a gesture of deep faith in ourselves. It takes courage and a great deal of not-knowing.
    - **The Structure of Destiny**
      - Human destiny unravels according to its own timing and structure. The Golden Path provides a structure that allows you to contemplate the Gene Keys in a personalised way, with specific Gene Keys relating to certain areas of your life. This is an inner voyage you will take over a period of time.
      - The Golden Path has three archetypal stages:
      - **Part 1. Discovering your Purpose – Activation Sequence**
      - **Part 2. Opening your Heart – Venus Sequence**
      - **Part 3. Releasing your Prosperity – Pearl Sequence**
      - Each of these three stages relates to the three questions above concerning purpose, relationships and community, and even though they may seem different from each other, you may well discover for yourself how deeply interconnected they are. No matter which phase of your life you are currently traveling through, you will see that the whole of your life is really a journey into purpose, love and prosperity. The intricate tapestry of your destiny depends on the art you bring to the actual process of daily living. As you take the journey through these three stages of the Golden Path, you will have the wonderful opportunity to grasp something of the structure of your own destiny, woven as it is into the fabric of your living DNA.
    - **Applying the Gene Keys to your life**
      - **The Magic Of Sequences** 
        - If you decide to tread the Golden Path through the Gene Keys, you are recommended to begin at the natural beginning, which is with the Activation Sequence and your four Prime Gifts. The magic of the Golden Path is that it provides you with a sequential structure to contemplate that unravels over time.
        - All of life and evolution follows natural sequences. However, the sequences of the Golden Path are not paths of development that change who you are. They are an unravelling of your highest essence that lies hidden within. Therefore when you travel these sequences, it is as though you are unpicking the tapestry of your life in reverse. You must check each stitch of the fabric and discard those knots and slips that have caused your life to take you into difficulties. Then as you rewire your own genetic patterns, you will be recreating your entire life from a clean slate.
        - Following your sequences takes time. You are asked to make a deep contemplation of your beliefs, your behaviour, your thought-life and the nature of your desires and dreams. The sequences will reveal to you anything that is out of alignment with the whole, and you will discard those parts of yourself that do not serve a higher purpose. This is the magic of the sequences at work – they are practical and they are transformational.
      - **Part 1 – The Activation Sequence**
        - **Grounding On The Physical Plane**
        - The Activation Sequence is the simplest of the 3 sequences that comprise the Golden Path. It serves a powerful purpose in orienting you physically into your body, into the centre of your inner world. It is a celebration of the beauty and dignity of your aloneness. As you contemplate the Gene Keys of your 4 Prime Gifts and their inner dynamics, you engage the activation sequence within you, which lays the foundation for a breakthrough in your life.
        - As you continue working with the Gene Keys through the other sequences, these breakthroughs will be ongoing. For this reason the Activation Sequence sets the foundation for your journey of transformation.
      - **Part 2 – The Venus Sequence**
        - **Navigating The Emotional Realm**
        - As the longest and most complex of the 3 sequences you will contemplate along the Golden Path, the Venus Sequence represents the core of these teachings. It is a journey into the heart and the wounding that we all carry around our hearts. The Venus Sequence reorients you in your life at an emotional level, exploring genetic themes of holding and release woven from the ancestral DNA you inherited at birth.
        - As you contemplate your Venus Sequence and its Gene Keys, you bring the transformation into your relationships through an increased awareness of the patterns that prevent you from living consistently with an open heart.
      - **Part 3 – The Pearl Sequence**
        - **Clarifying Vision on the Mental Plane**
        - When you arrive at the Pearl Sequence, you may begin to view many aspects of your life in a new light. As you spend time activating the higher frequencies of the Gene Keys inside you, a new vision of your life begins to dawn. This vision comes as a natural unfolding once your emotional patterns are understood and accepted. Once you begin to relate clearly and cleanly with others, the codes of your higher purpose begin to attract new opportunities towards you.
        - The Pearl Sequence assists you in clarifying exactly how you are best designed to serve the whole. The Pearl shows you how your unique talents can best be used to ensure you become truly prosperous at all levels.
        - Each of the three sequences of the Golden Path are part of an unfolding mystery that will take you on a journey of transformation into your everyday life. Even though each sequence appears separate and moves within time, they are in fact all interconnected. The magic of these linear sequences is that they paradoxically intensify your experience of the present moment.
    - **Working and Playing with the Gene Keys**
      - There are many ways of using the Gene Keys in your life. They are an invitation to your own imagination. The Golden Path is simply one of these many ways, and if understood correctly, it offers one of the steepest expansion curves you may ever have encountered in your life. The time you give to this process may well propel you into a whole new phase in your life. Therefore the Golden Path is a path to tread lightly but not to take lightly. It has the capacity to pull you sharply back into your own centre, into the steep, untrespassed sanctity of your aloneness.
      - The central path of the Gene Keys is one of contemplation. You imbibe the truths of the Keys inside yourself over a sustained period of time. You play with the Gene Keys, offering them up to the power of your imagination, until your body begins to inwardly glow with a new lightness. The Gene Keys are about igniting the light that lies dormant within your own core. Indeed, they are a contemplation on light itself. The secret lies in sustained contemplation. In this sense, contemplation is a lifelong endeavour. This doesn’t mean you have to contemplate the Gene Keys for the rest of your life, but that at a certain point you will no longer need them and they will fall away naturally as you begin to embody the truth of their wisdom in your daily life.
    - **Individuation – The Purpose of the Journey**
      - As was stated earlier, the Golden Path is about bringing a higher harmony back into our lives. It is about being natural. It is about seeing life through the Water Eye – that part of us that can always sense and follow the path of least resistance in life. The final goal of the Golden Path is to bring you to a state known as ‘individuation’. Individuation refers to a process whereby the many different aspects of your life – your dreams, your relationships, your health, your finances, your spirituality – are brought together into an integrated harmony.
      - An individuated human being is a person whose inner life is in exact harmony with their outer life. In such a person, everything has become simplified. The power of your aloneness is the font of your strength, but it in no way isolates you from your community. On the contrary, your aloneness serves to strengthen your bonds within your community. In an individuated being, many emotional states are naturally processed and transmuted internally, causing far less friction, confusion or energy loss in the environment.
      - This also brings far more ease and simplicity into all your relationships. The more individuated you become, the more energy efficient you become. At the same time, individuation does not mean you will become more ‘spiritual’. It retains full involvement of our passions and those difficult states we often refer to as our Shadows. The difference between an individuated human being and a conditioned human being is that the former lives in a state of self-forgiveness. Individuation should be understood as different from any so-called spiritual state. It is not the same as enlightenment or realisation. Rather it is a prerequisite for such states. Individuation is a state of ease
      - Individuation speaks of an inner maturity in which the hungry search for spiritual truth has settled down inside us, bringing our whole system into a profound sense of balance and ease. When we come into a state of individuation our spirituality has become internalised. We are naturally inclined to speak less about our insight and to maintain appropriate boundaries around ourselves emotionally and psychologically.
      - At the same time, we find that the ordinary world around us is welcoming and fruitful and we meet it with a refreshing sense of openness.
      - The individuated human being rarely separates him or herself from the marketplace but is content to move among the world as an ordinary person. Individuation is a powerful and humble place to arrive at in your life. It may not appear exciting to the externally hungry mind, but it conveys the secret weight of the patience and calm that you have anchored deep into your DNA. To be individuated is to court the subtle and the invisible and at the same time it is to shine out with the light of your humanity.
      - To tread the Golden Path through the Gene Keys is a grand adventure. It is an ancient adventure clothed in a contemporary form. While its potential is life changing, much depends upon you the voyager. You are invited to bring your full imaginative self into the process. It is your journey into your life, and the more honest and aware you can be with yourself, the more profound your self illumination will be.
    - **Take a short pause here** **and find a creative way to affirm to be 100% honest and gentle with yourself as you travel through this programme.**
      - **Feel free to use your notes to capture your insights and reflections**.
      - **The more honest you are with yourself, the more powerful your revelation will be…**

    - **Explanation**
      - Throughout this book and your journey with the Golden Path you are swimming within a rich field of high frequency terminology. This is one of the things that makes working with your Profile so powerful. As you contemplate and turn these words over inside yourself they can help you to gain clarity and insight. At times within the text you will come across new terms. Most of the terms below are defined in the Glossary of Personal Empowerment at the back of the Gene Keys book. However, instead of putting these terms in a glossary at the end of this course (which you might forget to read), we have included them here at the beginning.
      - **This next section is all about you learning the Gene Keys language. Although you are probably keen to get to grips with understanding your Profile, this is an important preparation, and having done it, you will have a far better grounding in the underlying concepts.**
      - **\Each of the terms below carries an empowerment, so they can be rewarding to read/watch and contemplate. Before moving on, you are advised to read through all these definitions (and watch the numerous videos) and let all this new language settle inside your awareness. This will be an important aspect of your ongoing contemplative practise with the Gene Keys.**

      - **Activation Sequence:**
        - The Activation Sequence is the primary genetic sequence in your Hologenetic Profile. The Activation Sequence describes a series of three leaps in awareness that unfold in your life as you activate the higher purpose within your DNA. These inner realisations are called your Challenge, your Breakthrough and your Core Stability. Calculated from the position of the sun at the time of your birth, your Activation Sequence pinpoints four specific Gene Keys (known as your Four Prime Gifts) that form the vibratory field of your genius. As its name suggests, your Activation Sequence is a trigger that can catalyse a period of intense transformation in your life.
      - **Awareness:**
        - An aspect of consciousness unique to all life forms. In a human being, awareness can be divided into three main layers, although in reality they are all a single awareness — physical awareness, emotional awareness and mental awareness. At low levels of frequency, human awareness is confined to the human body — physical awareness remains rooted in survival and fear, emotional awareness remains rooted in desire and drama and mental awareness remains rooted in comparison and judgment. As you raise the frequency throughout your being, your awareness becomes more refined and shifts from the local environment to the cosmic. Physical awareness becomes Divine presence, emotional awareness becomes universal love and mental awareness becomes silence and wisdom.
      - **Concentration:**
        - One of the three primary paths leading to the higher states of Absorption and Embodiment. Concentration is the left hand path, represented by the ancient science of yoga. It utilises focused effort and willpower to bring about a series of transformations that gradually raise the frequency of your awareness.
      - **Contemplation:**
        - One of the three primary paths leading to the higher states of Absorption and Embodiment. Contemplation is the central path, represented by the Tao. It utilises elements of both concentration (effort) and meditation (no effort) to bring about a heightening of your frequency. Contemplation takes place on all three of the lower human planes; there is physical contemplation, emotional contemplation and mental contemplation. Over time, contemplation transforms the physical, astral and mental bodies into their higher frequency counterparts — the causal, buddhic and atmic bodies. Prolonged contemplation on the 64 Gene Keys is one of the quickest and easiest ways to activate the higher frequencies lying latent within your DNA.
      - **Frequency:**
        - A means of measuring the vibratory nature of radiant energy such as sound, light or even awareness. The central premise of the Gene Keys Synthesis is that you can alter the frequency of light passing through your DNA, thereby speeding up or slowing down the force of evolution itself. Through deep contemplation on the 64 Gene Keys and their teachings, you can raise the frequency of your DNA and thus change the vibratory frequency of your aura, coming into higher and higher states of harmony with the entire universe.
      - **Frequency Band:**
        - In the Gene Keys Synthesis, the vibratory rate of your aura is mirrored in three frequency ‘bands’ known as the Shadow, the Gift and the Siddhi. Although there are in fact many layers or bandwidths of frequency, this threefold language makes the Gene Keys simple to understand, contemplate and ultimately embody. The three frequency bands are laid out precisely through the Spectrum of Consciousness – the linguistic map of the 64 Gene Keys and their frequency bands.
      - **Gene Key:**
        - One of 64 universal attributes of consciousness. Each Gene Key is a multi-dimensional portal into your inner being whose sole purpose is to activate your higher purpose and ultimately allow you to embrace your own Divinity. Your higher purpose is activated through sustained contemplation of the Gene Keys and their frequency bands.
      - **Genius:**
        - The innate intelligence of all human beings. True genius (as opposed to intellectual genius) is a spontaneous and unstudied creative uniqueness rooted in unconditional love. Genius is the natural manifestation of a human life when it is allowed to expand without force. Genius is a hallmark of the Gift frequency band where self-forgiveness leads to a progressive opening of your heart, resulting in an explosion of creative energy throughout your being. The higher the frequency of your DNA rises, the greater your urge will be to use your genius in service to the whole. As more and more people join their genius together, the world as we see it today will be transformed.
      - **Gift (Frequency):**
        - The frequency band relating to human genius and open-heartedness. As your awareness enters more fully into the Shadow frequencies, it unlocks latent energy held within your DNA. This energy is released through your physical, astral and mental bodies as light. Physically, this can lead to changes in your body chemistry and increased vitality. Emotionally, it can lead to uplifting feelings, joyousness and a pervading sense of optimism. Mentally, it can lead to insight and great creativity.
        - The Gift frequency is a process of gradual revelation as your true higher nature (the Siddhi) is unveiled. There are many states and stages within the Gift frequency band and it represents the quantum field where the forces of involution and evolution come together. One of the hallmarks of the Gift frequency is the ability to take full responsibility for one’s own karma – that is one’s thoughts, feelings, words and actions. At this level of frequency, one no longer identifies as a victim of any perceived external stimulus.
      - **Hexagram:**
        - A pictographic binary symbol that forms the basis of the I Ching. The 64 hexagrams of the I Ching are directly analogous to the 64 Gene Keys. Each hexagram is made up of six lines, either broken (yin) or unbroken (yang). The Gene Keys offer a modern interpretation of the 64 hexagrams as they relate to our core genetic structure and to the underlying structure of the universe itself. Each Hexagram or Gene Key is a portal to an encyclopaedia of knowledge and insight about yourself and your place in the universe. Through sustained contemplation on the hexagrams, their structure and interdependence, you can raise the frequency of light moving through your DNA and experience life at a new level of awareness.
      - **I Ching:**
        - The original ‘prima materia’ of the Gene Keys, the I Ching is a sacred Chinese text dating from around the 4th century BC. Many commentaries and versions of the I Ching exist and it is perhaps best known as a popular oracle. The Gene Keys are a natural culmination of all previous incarnations of the I Ching. They ultimately point to the truth that all sacred texts have their source inside us. The same truths intuitively grasped by the ancient sages can now be proven by modern genetics — that the universe is built upon natural codes and these codes can be deciphered and unlocked. The original I Ching was held in the highest esteem as a sacred text with the capacity to mirror living wisdom in every moment. Likewise the Gene Keys point us inwardly to seek the source of our suffering in our Shadows and guide us in transforming that suffering into creativity and freedom.
      - **Meditation:**
        - One of the three primary paths leading to the higher states of Absorption and Embodiment. Meditation is the right hand path, represented by the ancient science of tantra. The true essence of the meditative path is to simply watch, witness and allow. Through meditation one gradually comes to the realisation that one’s true nature dwells in a choice-less awareness. This great revelation may come as a gentle unfolding that raises the frequency of your awareness over time or as a sudden implosion that allows you a permanent experience of your Divine Self — or it may come as both.
      - **Mutation:**
        - An unpredictable event that breaks the continuity in any linear sequence, at any level within the universe. In genetic terms, mutations are ‘mistakes’ made during cell replication. Mutation is the mother of difference, since it creates endless forks in the evolutionary impulse, leading to new and unseen processes. In our everyday lives, mutations also occur all the time. They occur whenever there is a break in the established patterns or rhythms of your life. It is our fear of mutation that fuels the Shadow frequency field. For example, when you find yourself moving through a period of mutation, you will feel a profound uncertainty about yourself and your life. If you repress or react to this feeling out of fear, you will disturb the processes of good fortune that always accompany mutation. As you learn to surrender to the natural mutative processes in your life, you will unlock the powerful creative gifts inside you and place yourself in alignment with the synchronicity of your true destiny.
      - **Pathway:**
        - In your Hologenetic Profile, the dynamic transformational processes that are either held in check by the Shadow frequencies of the Gene Keys or unlocked by their higher frequencies. Each Pathway acts as a conductor of the twin forces of evolution and involution.
      - **Pearl Sequence:**
        - The third and final sequence comprising the Golden Path, the Pearl Sequence is the primary genetic sequence for opening up our mental awareness to operate on a higher plane. Constructed from the positions of Mars, Jupiter and the sun at the time of your birth, the Pearl Sequence is a contemplative journey using the Gene Keys whose purpose is to open your mind to a transcendent view of the universe. Such a view allows one to see the inherent simplicity of life and move one’s energies and resources into alignment with it. Your individual Pearl Sequence is made up of four specific Gene Keys which have a direct bearing on your ability to be efficient and prosperous in your life. Each of these four Gene Keys shows you a Shadow pattern that prevents you from living a prosperous and liberating life. As your awareness enters into these patterns and unlocks their hidden Gifts, you will discover a resource of untapped genius and creativity. The other great secret of the Pearl Sequence is the power of philanthropy as a world view. The Pearl allows us to find our closest allies and work together in service to our community and a higher goal. The Pearl Sequence
      - **Prime Gifts:**
        - Calculated by the time, date and place of your birth, the Prime Gifts are a series of four Gene Keys that relate profoundly to your overall purpose in life. Known as your Life’s Work, your Evolution, your Radiance and your Purpose, the Prime Gifts represent the living field of your genius that was imprinted in your DNA at the point of conception. By understanding and embracing the Shadow aspects of the Gene Keys that correspond to your four Prime Gifts you will activate their higher frequencies and catalyse a mutation to take place deep within your DNA. This process is known as the Activation Sequence. By sustained contemplation on the highest frequencies of your four Prime Gifts you will witness a complete transformation in your life as you unlock the true genius inside you.
      - **Programming Partners:**
        - Two Gene Keys that are holographically bonded together through opposition — in other words, they are exact mirror opposites. There are 32 such programming partners within the genetic matrix, and each creates a biofeedback loop that reinforces the themes of those Gene Keys at every level of frequency. At the Shadow frequency, the programming partners create physical, emotional and mental patterns and complexes that mutually reinforce each other. As awareness penetrates these patterns and transforms them, they release waves of creative energy at the Gift frequency, which in turn are mutually reinforced, leading to a continual raising of one’s evolutionary frequency. At the Siddhic frequency, the programming partners no longer oppose each other but dawn as pure consciousness, creating a harmonic so pure that it deletes their difference. Programming Partners
      - **Sequence:**
        - The means by which cellular transformation is unlocked and awakening is catalysed. As we learn to accept the Shadow frequencies in our lives, so we become witness to a progressive unlocking of the higher codes of consciousness within our bodies.
      - **Shadow (Frequency):**
        - The frequency band relating to all human suffering. The Shadow frequency band emerges from an ancient wiring in the human brain. Such wiring is based on individual survival and is linked directly to fear. The unconscious presence of fear in our system continues to enhance our belief that we are separate from the world around us. This deep-seated belief propagates a ‘victim’ mentality, since the moment we believe we are separate, we feel vulnerable and at the mercy of outside forces. When we live at the Shadow frequency band then we live within a culture of blame and shame. We blame those forces and people that we believe are outside us, and we feel shame when we believe we alone are responsible for our lives. Once you begin to understand how the Shadow frequency controls the majority of people in the world, including yourself, you realise how simple it is to move out of its grasp. Simply by shifting your attitude, you release the creative currents hidden within the Shadow frequencies and your life takes on a higher purpose. Your very suffering becomes the source of your salvation. Thus begins your journey away from those internal patterns and traits that keep you believing you are a victim and towards the inherent genius and love that is your true nature.
      - **Siddhi (Frequency):**
        - The frequency band relating to full embodiment and spiritual realisation. The very concept of frequencies and levels paradoxically dissolves when the Truth is realised as a Siddhi. The word ‘siddhi’ is from the Sanskrit meaning ‘Divine Gift’. The siddhic state only comes about when all vestiges of the Shadow, particularly at a collective level, have been transformed into light. As you enter the state of Absorption, this alchemical transformation begins to accelerate, until finally, all falls silent and you enter the state of Embodiment at the Sixth Initiation. There are 64 Siddhis and each one refers to a different expression of Divine Realisation. Even though the realisation is the same in each case, its expression will differ and can even appear contradictory. The Siddhis spoken of in the Gene Keys Synthesis are not to be confused with the way they are understood in certain other mystical traditions. The 64 Siddhis are not obstacles on the path to realisation but are the very expression and fruition of realisation.
      - **Sphere:**
        - In your Holgenetic Profile, a specific aspect of your life that has a corresponding Gene Key and line attributed to it. Providing focal points for ongoing contemplation the eleven spheres form the sequential steps along the Golden Path.
      - **The** **Golden Path:**
        - The master genetic sequence for permanently raising your frequency from the Shadow to the Gift frequency. An integration of the Activation Sequence, the Venus Sequence and the Pearl Sequence, the Golden Path describes the natural unfolding of human awareness as it matures beyond the victim patterns of the Shadow frequency. All human beings sooner or later must walk some form of the Golden Path, as it symbolises the passage of the individuated ‘soul’ through the first four Initiations. As your lower three bodies (the physical, the astral and the mental) are gradually purified and brought into harmonic resonance, you will experience the opening of your heart and the releasing of your creative genius into the world. The Golden Path lays the foundation for living a high frequency life.
      - **The Six Lines:**
        - Relating to the hexagram structure of the I Ching, the Six Lines describe further nuances of each of the 64 Gene Keys. If we see each Gene Key as a pre-designed archetypal picture, then each line is like the colour of that picture. Once you can see the colour, the whole picture comes alive. Knowing the six lines and their keynotes is an essential skill to master, as it enables you to interpret the many elements of the Hologenetic Profle in a simple and accessible way. There are many, many layers of keynotes for each of the six lines and they are fun to learn and illuminating to apply. The deeper you can feel the resonance of the six lines inside your being, the easier it is to understand your own sequences and share that resonance with others.
      - **Transmutation:**
        - The process of dynamic and permanent change that comes about as you surrender and accept mutation. At the Shadow frequency, mutation is something that is greatly feared as it always challenges an established pattern, rhythm or routine. Unless mutations (periods of natural upheaval) are embraced and fully accepted in your life, transmutation cannot occur. Transmutation involves a complete shift from one state or plane to another. After a transmutation, nothing is ever the same again. Transmutation only begins to occur at the Gift frequency band, as your deepest cellular victim patterns are transformed through awareness. Periods of intense mutation in your life are always a great opportunity for transmutation. So long as your attitude is open-hearted and accepting and you embrace and take responsibility for your own state, transmutation will occur in your life. With transmutation comes great clarity, freedom and creativity. It is the process through which your genius emerges into the world.
      - **Venus Sequence:**
        - The primary genetic sequence for unlocking deep core emotional patterns in your life. As the central axis of the Golden Path, the Venus Sequence is an inner contemplative journey into the dynamics of your specific emotional wounding patterns, inherited through your ancestral DNA. Constructed from the positions of the earth, moon, Mars and Venus at the time of your birth, the Venus Sequence outlines a natural pathway of six Gene Keys which govern all your emotional patterns in this life. As your awareness begins to understand and observe the Shadow aspects of these six Gene Keys, particularly in your relationships, you will begin to transform the low frequency patterns into higher frequency Gifts. In this way, your astral body (your emotional nature) moves through a process of transmutation leading to the permanent opening of your heart. During our current phase of evolution known as the Great Change, the Venus Sequence has particular relevance as its underlying purpose is to open up a new centre of awareness in the solar plexus.
