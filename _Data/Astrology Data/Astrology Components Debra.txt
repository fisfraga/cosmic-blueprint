Astrological Components

The Four Elements 🔥🌍💨💧
The elements describe the fundamental energy and consciousness of the signs.

Fire (Aries, Leo, Sagittarius): Fire signs are characterized by their passion, energy, and loudness. When reacting to an intense emotional situation, a fire sign's emotional body escalates into drama and anger. Their life lesson involves being seen and expressing their passions without needing external applause.

Earth (Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn): Earth signs are inherently grounded and practical. Under pressure, they become pragmatic, focusing on problem-solving and results while sometimes disregarding the emotional experience. Their life lessons often revolve around money, security, and respecting the physical realm.

Air (Gemini, Libra, Aquarius): Air signs are cerebral, communicative thinkers. When pushed, they retreat into their heads and try to logically explain their feelings. Their primary lessons in life are centered on relationships and communication.

Water (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces): Water signs can't help but be sensitive. In an intense emotional confrontation, they are likely to go quiet and withdraw completely. Their life lesson is to feel their feelings, set boundaries, and maintain faith in love despite heartbreaks.

The Planets 🪐
The planets represent the different facets of your personality and the energies at play in your life.

Sun ☀️
The Sun represents your life-force, ego, and the outward expression of your character. It's the centerpiece of who you are, dictating your instinctual, knee-jerk reactions and how you appear in the world. Like the chairperson of a board, the Sun sets the tone for your life and needs attention, praise, and affirmation to thrive. The Sun rules the sign of Leo.

Moon 🌙
The Moon governs your internal world, emotions, instincts, and the unconscious mind. It influences the psychic and intuitive parts of your personality. Because the Moon moves quickly, it explains how moods can change without an apparent reason. The Moon's energy is maternal and emotionally wise at its best, but can manifest as moodiness and sensitivity at its worst. The Moon rules the sign of Cancer.

Mercury 🗣️
Mercury represents the mind, communication, and the processing of information. This planet is like a winged messenger, influencing how you think, speak, and connect with others. It's the part of you that asks questions, gathers data, and organizes the agenda. On the low road, Mercury's energy can be distracted and scattered. Mercury rules both Gemini and Virgo.

Mercury Retrograde: This is not a "bad" time but an opportunity to go backward and review, revisit, reconsider, and return. It's a period that invites you to be meticulous and conscientious rather than a time that insists things will go wrong.

Venus ❤️
Venus is the planet of love, beauty, art, and values. It rules your tastes, your favorite things, and the delicious parts of life, including money, food, and security. As the "HR director," Venus is concerned with harmony, ethics, and ensuring that everyone feels cared for and valued. Its low road can manifest as vanity, gossip, and judgment. Venus rules Taurus and Libra.

Mars 💪
Mars, the red planet, governs power, energy, and assertiveness. It addresses your get-up-and-go, physical prowess, and ability to be fearlessly direct. Mars is goal-oriented and wants to get straight to the point, seeking efficiency and clear direction. On the low road, this energy can be harsh, arrogant, and insensitive to others' feelings. Mars rules Aries.

Jupiter 🎉
Jupiter is the planet of all things large: fun, expansion, luck, and travel. Described as a jolly Santa Claus, Jupiter brings excitement, motivation, and inspiration. If Jupiter is in a favorable position in your chart, it indicates you were born under a lucky star. The low road of Jupiter's influence can be indulgence, self-righteousness, and overly opinionated behavior. Jupiter rules Sagittarius.

Saturn 🪐
Saturn is the taskmaster, representing rules, discipline, responsibility, and your life's purpose. It is a stern influence that determines the lessons you must learn through effort and follow-through. Saturn is like the company's COO, focused on timelines, goals, and accountability. While its lessons can feel like hardship, accepting them leads to success and public acclaim. The Saturn Return, occurring between ages 28-30 and 58-60, is a pivotal time of change and destiny. Saturn rules Capricorn.

Uranus ⚡
Uranus influences uniqueness, eccentricity, rebellion, and sudden change. Discovered during the French Revolution, its energy is about breaking rules, thinking outside the box, and paradigm-shifting ideas. Uranus rules intuition, technology, and humanitarianism. Its low road can manifest as a high-strung nervous system, anxiety, and being a rebel without a cause. Uranus rules Aquarius.

Neptune 🎨
Neptune governs the otherworldly, altered states, creativity, and spirituality. Its realm includes fine art, music, dreams, and all means of escaping the mundane world, including drugs and alcohol. This planet influences the invisible realm, making those with its strong influence highly sensitive and intuitive. The low road of Neptune is confusion, illusion, addiction, and being lost in space. Neptune rules Pisces.

Pluto трансформа
Pluto represents the power of the unconscious mind, transformation, and the human shadow. Though small and distant, it wields significant influence over themes like death, power, and obsession. Pluto's placement in your chart reveals your passion and your capacity for healing and deep change. On the low road, Pluto's energy is controlling, manipulative, and destructive. Pluto rules Scorpio.

The Twelve Houses 🏠

First House (Aries): The house of the self. It governs your appearance, ego, independence, and physical life-force.
