‭ Abstract:‬
‭ A universal taxonomy for language and consciousness is proposed through an integrative‬
‭ approach combining physics, mythology, psychology, and synergetics. While this study is‬
‭ completed in the English language, it applies to meaning structures which can be seen across‬
‭ languages and cultures. While objective analysis of abstract categorical structures commonly‬
‭ leads to division in taxonomy meanings across use cases and contexts, accounting for the‬
‭ subjective observer and leveraging first principles for inquiry leads to integration of meanings‬
‭ into clearly cascading trees of transcendent and descendent properties. In addition, we find‬
‭ interoperability between cultural, religious, spiritual, and scientific contexts.‬
‭ Introduction:‬
‭ Every culture on Earth has some contemplation, whether through mythology, religion,‬
‭ spirituality, physics, or other field of study, around the origin of existence. Within these cultures,‬
‭ individuals grapple with similar inquiries in forms like: “who am I?”, “where did I come from?”,‬
‭ and “what is the meaning of life?” An observation that is helpful in addressing further concepts‬
‭ in this paper is that cultures are made of individuals, and so there is a natural scalar hierarchy to‬
‭ this inquiry. Contemplating these foundational questions on existence itself leads to the origin of‬
‭ our language taxonomy, as it essentially is inquiring about the origin of everything, including‬
‭ language.‬
‭ Every scientific and academic inquiry must address the perspective of its study within a specific‬
‭ context, whether that is to understand the source components of a specific chemical or the forces‬
‭ which give rise to a particular event. What happens when we address the nature of perspective‬
‭ and context itself? While studies of consciousness are rife with the challenges of overcoming‬
‭ subjectivity and bias, approaching this challenge through language provides a route to objective‬
‭ analysis of meaning and implication. Therefore, it is possible to apply results from academic‬
‭ inquiries toward mapping our universal taxonomy, even if it may appear to extend beyond the‬
‭ context bounds of specific academic fields.‬
‭ Universal Taxonomy White Paper 1‬
‭ Foundational concepts in physics like polarity, spectra, and harmonics serve as key anchors for‬
‭ organization within our graph, as these ideas link to structures of meaning apparent in our‬
‭ language. Another observation here, is that the physics of spacetime shapes and informs the‬
‭ faculties of our physical perception, and so defining processes and terms in physics provides‬
‭ language which can describe the nature of our perception itself.‬
‭ While some metaphysical approaches would suggest that this limits our understanding of‬
‭ perception due to transcendent or non-physical aspects of our conscious awareness, other‬
‭ integrative approaches acknowledge that there are patterns in both physical (eg: trees) and‬
‭ non-physical phenomena (eg: mathematical fractals) which are self-similar. This idea is‬
‭ embodied in traditions which have a form of “as above, so below” metaphysics, expressing the‬
‭ idea that there is a connection between events in apparently non-physical experiences and‬
‭ physical ones.‬
‭ The Source of Language:‬
‭ In seeking an origin point for our taxonomy, we need look no further than words which are‬
‭ intended to encompass all other language. Even the word everything , while close to the source, is‬
‭ not quite there, as it is opposed by the idea of nothing. Philosophy and theology have long dealt‬
‭ with this problem and have pointed to concepts which can encompass both everything and‬
‭ nothing.‬
‭ Stage 1 Terms:‬
‭ God – Source – Omni – Cosmic – Divine‬
‭ The word infinite and its synonyms do not operate at this same level of our taxonomy, because‬
‭ they are embedded with polarity (eg. endless , immeasurable, boundless, etc.), and at this stage‬
‭ we are looking at meaning which is transcendent to these concepts which contain an opposite.‬
‭ Any language which contains a negative prefix or suffix has a positive form.‬
‭ We have already essentially defined the next stage in the taxonomy in this process, which is the‬
‭ emergence of polarity, temporality, and differentiation. However, it is important that we stay as‬
‭ close to all-encompassing forms of meaning in this next step, and look at the fundamental‬
‭ polarities inherent in each word.‬
‭ Stage 2 Terms:‬
‭ Universal Taxonomy White Paper 2‬
‭ Everything / Nothing – Time / Timeless – Absolute / Relative – Conscious / Unconscious –‬
‭ Eternal / Temporal – Infinite / Finite – Immeasurable / Measurable – Existence / Non-Existence‬
‭ – Oneness / Differentiation – All / None – Yes / No‬
‭ In other languages: Yang / Yin (Eastern Philosophy) – Sat (Existence) / Asat (Non-Existence)‬
‭ (Indian Philosophy) – Mu (Nothingness) / U (Existence) (Zen/Shinto) – Purusha‬
‭ (Consciousness) / Prakriti (Nature) (Vedic Philosophy) – Ein Sof (Infinite) / Sefirot (Finite)‬
‭ (Hebrew Kabbalah) – Fana (Annihilation) / Baqa (Permanence) (Islamic Sufism) – Chaos /‬
‭ Cosmos (Greek Philosophy) – Ao (Light) / Po (Darkness) (Polynesian Philosophy) – Kami‬
‭ (Sacred) / Kegare (Profane) (Shinto) – Sky / Earth (Native American Philosophy) – As Above /‬
‭ So Below (Egyptian Hermeticism)‬
‭ Here we may assume that the term everything also encompasses the other terms in this series.‬
‭ However, terms like timeless naturally break this illusion, as being “without time” essentially has‬
‭ the same meaning as nothing , especially when considering that everything is a concept similarly‬
‭ bound to time , as it is to perception of anything. In consideration of the meanings of absolute and‬
‭ relative, we can see that they are determinations of our perception itself, as everything and‬
‭ nothing are potentially relative or absolute depending on our meaning.‬
‭ At this stage we observe that there is interconnectivity between terms at each stage of our‬
‭ universal taxonomy. They are interchangeable to an extent, but more importantly, they are‬
‭ interoperable at the same level of inquiry. To elaborate, each term at this stage encompasses the‬
‭ most vast subsets of meaning possible, while also having naturally emergent opposites.‬
‭ The binary nature of these terms, which we will refer to as Seeds, is carried through to each‬
‭ taxonomy sequence in the Trees of meaning which grow from them.‬
‭ Binary Sequence Trees:‬
‭ A useful model for our study of the complex evolution of polarities inherent in these taxonomies‬
‭ is the I-Ching. This ancient “divination” system, while theorized to have its roots in oriental‬
‭ metaphysics, contains the fundamental principles behind binary computer code, and codon‬
‭ combinations in genetics.‬
‭ In the I-Ching, you have two primary symbols, one representing Yin and the other Yang. The‬
‭ words Yin and Yang are difficult to define, as they operate at the level of Stage 2 Terms and can‬
‭ essentially represent the fundamental nature of polarity itself. Here we will use their symbolic‬
‭ representation as primitives to diagram and better understand the polarity dynamics in our‬
‭ taxonomy.‬
‭ Universal Taxonomy White Paper 3‬
‭ Yang Yin‬

⚊ ⚋
‭ These primitives interplay with each other, giving the following logical binary progressions:‬
‭ Ultimate Yang Rising Yang Rising Yin Ultimate Yin‬

⚌
⚍
⚎
⚏





‭ Traditional I-Ching coin tosses essentially resolve to these four energetic dynamics. Using three‬
‭ coins, one can reveal only four combinations:‬
‭ 1. All Yang (Ultimate Yang / Greater Yang)‬
‭ 2. One Yang, Two Yin (Rising Yang / Lesser Yin)‬
‭ 3. One Yin, Two Yang (Rising Yin / Lesser Yang)‬
‭ 4. All Yin (Ultimate Yin / Greater Yin)‬
‭ It is important to note that this symbolic system does not allow for an exact point of balance‬
‭ between opposites. In the above progression, Yang becomes “Rising Yin” while Yin becomes‬
‭ “Rising Yang” as they interact with each other, implying a change in time or motion towards the‬
‭ other polarity. There is no center point of equilibrium, though it is acknowledgement of balance‬
‭ or equilibrium between opposites that leads us to Stage 3 Terms in our approach to a universal‬
‭ taxonomy. The I-Ching’s dynamic polarity Is still critical to our process, however.‬
‭ For the purposes of this paper, we will adapt an additional symbol to reflect the point of balance‬
‭ within the polarities of meaning we study. We will use the Sun symbol for ease of recognition:‬
‭ ⚌⚍☉⚎⚏‬
‭ The next stage of binary progression reveals the following sequence, which we will reference in‬
‭ more depth later in this paper:‬
‭ ☰☱☴☲☉☵☳☶☷‬
‭ Note that each symbol in the sequence has its exact opposite polarity on the other side, even‬
‭ though each symbol is also an interplay between opposites.‬
‭ Universal Taxonomy White Paper 4‬
‭ The Great Trinity‬
‭ In order to address Stage 3 Terms in our universal taxonomy, we must explore the idea of‬
‭ balance in more depth. Each of the terms in Stage 2 present polar opposites, but in each case,‬
‭ there is no known term, idea, or meaning for what lies in exact equilibrium between the two‬
‭ terms. There is no center point between everything and nothing , or absolute and relative.‬
‭ We can apply this realization as a test when considering differentiation between Stage 2 and‬
‭ Stage 3 Terms, namely that Stage 3 Terms will always allow for a third term which balances the‬
‭ other two, while Stage 2 Terms will not.‬
‭ Returning to our fundamental philosophical approach, in this stage we are more prepared to‬
‭ move from our esoteric language set to terms accessible to physics and science, though not‬
‭ without some recognition that transcendent terms and meanings remain ever present.‬
‭ We have acknowledged existence and its opposite non-existence in Stage 2. Now we can look at‬
‭ dynamic actions or processes connected to these ideas, for example: creating and destroying ,‬
‭ where creating is expressing a move towards existence while destroying is a move towards‬
‭ non-existence. Our test for Stage 3 Terms works here: something can exist without doing either‬
‭ of these actions. Moreover, there is language which reflects the neutralization of either action,‬
‭ such as balancing . Embedded in the equilibrium between creation and destruction is‬
‭ preservation .‬
‭ In many Asian traditions, the concept of balance is also reflected in the idea of harmony . This is‬
‭ not simply a psychological cultural framing, however. Balance and harmony are a goal state for‬
‭ life experience, but they are also keys principles applied to the visual arts, gardening, martial‬
‭ arts, tea ceremony, and practical approaches to architecture, city planning, and more within many‬
‭ oriental cultures.‬
‭ In the science of music, harmony also plays a direct role as synergy between wavelengths of‬
‭ sound, averting destructive interference. While harmony does generate constructive interference‬
‭ ( amplification ), this is distinct from creating new sound. This reveals more terms we can‬
‭ consider in building a tree of meaning from the balance point in the trinity of meaning at this‬
‭ Stage.‬
‭ Nearly every spiritual, metaphysical, religious, or cultural tradition that holds the “Trinity” as a‬
‭ fundamental concept links with this semantic tree. The Hermetic principle of gender is also at‬
‭ play here, with a masculine principle, a feminine principle, and the reproductive or progeny‬
‭ principle, that which arises from the interaction between the gender principles.‬

‭ The Quantum Quaternion‬
‭ In physics, we have several approaches to looking at the first dynamics in the Universe. In the‬
‭ Big Bang Model where the universe originates from some singular point (potentially a proton‬
‭ exiting in another Universe, as Nassim Haramein has proposed), everything is essentially “one‬
‭ thing,” and then becomes differentiated. This occurs through two known processes:‬
‭ thermodynamic gradients and charge polarity.‬
‭ Thermodynamic gradients are essentially translated as the differentiation between heat and‬
‭ cooling , though in discussing the birth of the universe it is worth mentioning the practical‬
‭ meaning is closer to “extremely hot” and “slightly less extremely hot.” It is useful to think of the‬
‭ entire Universe at this stage as one giant blazing star of energy, more dense than the largest‬
‭ neutron stars [1]‬
‭ we have ever discovered, but not due to heavy elements of matter, yet. At this‬
‭ point the Universe’s development, we have a clear theoretical model which points to the extreme‬
‭ energy inherent in the fabric of spacetime itself. The details of this model are too elaborate for‬
‭ exploration in this paper, but it is useful for our purposes here to imagine highly energetic‬
‭ spheres of energy compressed into each other and vibrating with such intensity that they are‬
‭ expanding the dimensional space they comprise attempting to reach equilibrium with each other,‬
‭ and cooling in the process.‬
‭ Thermodynamic gradients [2]‬
‭ in the Universe generate motion or spin, as well as charge. Consider‬
‭ the temperature and pressure interactions which cause storms. The more severe the‬
‭ thermodynamic gradients between hot and cold, high and low air pressures, the more powerful‬
‭ the rotation of the storm (tornadoes and hurricanes as high intensity examples), and the more‬
‭ Universal Taxonomy White Paper 6‬
‭ electrical charge that storm generates. In air, those thermodynamic gradients are based on‬
‭ vibration , with higher temperatures relating to faster molecular vibration, and lower temperatures‬
‭ with less vibrational energy.‬
‭ Returning to our model of the early Universe, areas of energy that are the hottest are the most‬
‭ chaotic, setting the stage for states that are destructive in nature. At a deeper stage of this paper,‬
‭ we will show how this destructive principle is deeply in service to Universal physical processes,‬
‭ and the taxonomy of consciousness itself (in other words, how we think about reality in general).‬
‭ In turn, areas within the “primordial soup” of energy in the early Universe that cool and move‬
‭ towards equilibrium through vibrational tensegrity begin to create new forms and distinctions,‬
‭ such as matter, spin and charge.‬
‭ The movement of the energetic spacetime soup seeking equilibrium (based on thermodynamic‬
‭ principles) naturally creates spin due to classical geometric and tensegrity principles elucidated‬
‭ by Buckminster Fuller, which we have applied to create the concept of vibrational tensegrity‬
‭ (where the push and pull, or radiative vibration and attraction, are equalized creating a geometric‬
‭ tension between nodes in the system). This spin creates a polar relationship between ends of a‬
‭ synchronously rotating and co-moving field (a spherical tensegrity field in tensegrity or‬
‭ geodesic), which fundamentally defines charge . These rotating co-moving fields stabilize at a‬
‭ specific size and speed threshold, forming the Unified Physics geodesic structure of the Proton‬
‭ (see Quantum Geometry by Adam Apollo). Protons are the fundamental unit of matter in the‬
‭ Universe, and they are not known to decay, ever.‬
‭ In addition, from a Unified Physics perspective since Protons are a spinning, curved energy field‬
‭ of spacetime, they collectively curve more spacetime, giving rise to the experience of the force‬
‭ of gravity at macrocosmic scales around celestial objects. The “strong force” is also just quantum‬
‭ gravity (intense spacetime curvature) within a short distance of a proton, and the quick falloff of‬
‭ its force potential is due to spacetime shearing as the Proton is spinning at the speed of light at its‬
‭ equator. The collective spacetime field which is pulled by torsion around a Proton is what we call‬
‭ the Electron field (co-moving spacetime), which enables molecular charge bonding, and‬
‭ propagates electromagnetic radiation , and is the fundamental unit of electrical current . Finally‬
‭ the “weak force” is unified with Electromagnetism and understood as spin decay.‬
‭ From this brief exploration of Unified Physics, we gain insight into four formative sectors which‬
‭ contain trees of meaning for our taxonomy. In our I-Ching symbols, note that the interconnected‬
‭ processes are mirrored in binary pairs, a process known in the Western Esoteric Tradition as‬
‭ Alchemy:‬

‭ These seeds in physics apply to a variety of cultural taxonomies. In Hermetic teachings [3]‬
‭ one of‬
‭ the seven principles of The Kybalion is Vibration , which embodies the idea that the Universe is‬
‭ mutable, constantly changing, and oscillating between states. This lens focuses our study to the‬
‭ specific dynamics of physics in the Universe which are processes that occur through the passage‬
‭ of time, and reveals that vibration or oscillation is fundamental to the arising of all forces and‬
‭ actions. Electromagnetism essentially captures this idea in physics, transcending and including‬
‭ spin and charge, and at the Planck scale, spacetime is theorized to be composed of fundamental‬
‭ electromagnetic oscillations. In essence, everything is Light in the most fundamental physics.‬
‭ As we mentioned briefly, any spectrum of forces (words) within a particular shared context will‬
‭ always contain a transcendent. Language is built from origins and descendants , as well as a form‬
‭ of semantic group theory, where we seek to name that which encompasses any group of related‬
‭ concepts.‬

‭ The Five Elements‬
‭ As we incorporate the transcendent in this series into our binary tree, we discover that these‬
‭ fundamental physics principles give rise to a much more familiar set of archetypal terms, which‬
‭ we will link to a few of the terms discussed above, and expand into new terms:‬
‭ Stage 5 Terms:‬
‭ Universal Taxonomy White Paper 8‬
‭ ☵ ☴ ☉ ☶ ☲‬
‭ Water Air Energy Earth Fire‬
‭ Liquid Gas Field Solid Plasma‬
‭ Hydro Aero Aether Geo Thermo‬
‭ Cool Spin Light Matter Heat‬
‭ Condense Torsion Vibration Polarity Entropy‬
‭ Wet Lightweight Potent Heavy Dry‬
‭ At this stage, our physics principles arise to a phenomenology which spectrally encompasses our‬
‭ direct experience of the physical world. There are countless terms which arise from this set; we‬
‭ are simply highlighting some common terms with many synonyms and antonyms. From this‬
‭ basis, we can begin to categorize nearly any physical process or phenomena, including our‬
‭ relationships to them.‬
‭ For example, in taking a set of projects focused on making a change to our natural physical‬
‭ world, we can easily organize them within the taxonomy of this archetypal spectrum.‬
‭ Water Air Energy Earth Fire‬
‭ River Cleanup Wind Power Electricity Tree Planting Disaster Prevention‬
‭ City Water Weather Systems Land Projects Emergencies‬
‭ It is also important to note here that the principle of polarity still exists inherent to each of the‬
‭ active faculties of these terms. In other words, we can ascertain opposites of each of these‬
‭ elemental processes in our taxonomy, so we must define which polarity of each term we are‬
‭ choosing when engaging a shared context. In the below examples, line A is one frame, while line‬
‭ B is the opposite frame:‬
‭ Water Air Energy Earth Fire‬
‭ Nourish Change Energize Integrate Damage -A‬
‭ Erode Persist Neutralize Stagnate Forge -B‬
‭ Notice that while some terms are destructive in one context, they become creative in their polar‬
‭ opposite context. In each set, we have attempted to balance term meanings within their relative‬
‭ frame.‬
‭ Through the lens of cultural anthropology, we recognize that these fundamental elements are also‬
‭ present in the metaphysics of many groups around the world. In ancient Irish, Celtic, Druidic,‬
‭ and Nordic traditions, the five elements of fire, air, earth, water, and spirit (energy) are central to‬
‭ Universal Taxonomy White Paper 9‬
‭ their spirituality, rituals, and traditions. Native American philosophies also incorporate these‬
‭ elements, often rendered as a “medicine wheel,” which represents directions, elements, and‬
‭ more. These traditions and Earth-based Religions associate the elements with cardinal directions,‬
‭ seasons, and other natural processes, though associations vary based on location. In the Irish‬
‭ Tuatha Dé Danann lineage, they are also associated with sacred tools. Each of these traditions‬
‭ have additional translations of the meanings of these elements, and the avid researcher will find‬
‭ correlations in these meanings to fundamental principles explored here.‬
‭ The Fundamental Spectrum‬
‭ As the next essential step in our binary progression, we recognize that the transcendent term‬
‭ energy not only encompasses the other terms in the elemental stage, it also contains its own‬
‭ binary structure of meaning which can be incorporated into a more comprehensive set. This set‬
‭ also allows the vibrational translation of each of the physical terms above into more subtle‬
‭ energetic or emotional terms.‬
‭ Introducing this concept, we will start with direct elemental terms from the I-Ching to reveal the‬
‭ fundamental spectra, then unpack their relationships to deeper metaphysical and psychological‬
‭ principles contained within different traditions and sciences:‬
‭ Stage 6 Terms:‬
‭ ☵ ☴ ☱ ☳ ☶ ☲‬
‭ Water Wind Lake Thunder Mountain Fire‬
‭ Water Air (Metal) Life (Wood) Electricity Earth Fire‬
‭ Flow Blow Birth Arouse Still Consume‬
‭ Connect Learn Cultivate Discover Become Transform‬
‭ Relation Intention Elation Realization Appreciation Passion‬
‭ Blue Yellow Orange Purple Green Red‬
‭ At this stage, we begin to recognize there is a natural harmonic progression of terms, where‬
‭ harmonic refers to both the spectra of meaning, as well as the expression of the vibrational‬
‭ encoding of the taxonomy through color . By exploring the psychological association with color,‬
‭ we open up an additional tree of terms related to this group, and polarities for each branch:‬
‭ Blue Yellow Orange Purple Green Red‬
‭ Universal Taxonomy White Paper 10‬
‭ Serenity Joy Pleasure Grace Love Desire -A‬
‭ Sadness Fear Deceit Superiority Envy Anger -B‬
‭ These base terms are useful for exploring an entire emotional vocabulary based on color, though‬
‭ this paper is not intended to be a comprehensive lexicon. It is also important to note that some‬
‭ specific cultures have strongly varying views on color association. However, many of these‬
‭ associations have arisen from political or environmental influence, while psychological studies‬
‭ have maintained that there are still general subconscious influences each color has for people‬
‭ around the world. [4]‬
‭ In the Appendices of this paper, we will provide a useful reference across‬
‭ each of the Stages, with additional terms.‬
‭ In Chinese Medicine and Taoism, this fundamental spectrum is seen through Five Element‬
‭ Theory (Wu Xing or the five phases), where fire, wood (life), metal (air), earth, and water form a‬
‭ balanced sequence of forces which contribute to physiological health through the body’s organs‬
‭ and meridians. Modern scientific analysis has shown that meridians exhibit electrical properties,‬
‭ where there is ionic conduction along the meridian passages [5]‬
‭ and impedance areas around‬
‭ specific points. [6]‬
‭ As we discussed previously, each spectral set has a natural transcendent, in this‬
‭ case electricity (the Thunder element) underlies the physics of this physiological practice in use‬
‭ for thousands of years. [7]‬
‭ An entire taxonomy of medical and biological associations expand from‬
‭ this basic elemental sequence.‬
‭ It is worth noting that this elemental sequence emerges by the prior term of energy or spirit‬
‭ giving rise to life , wood, or lake as its own element. It is commonly theorized that electricity is‬
‭ involved in amino acid generation in the primordial soup of elements on planets that gave rise to‬
‭ life, and electrical impulses are found in all living organisms, all the way down to the‬
‭ fundamental coding processes of RNA transcription and protein generation.‬
‭ Applications in Social Impact Sectors‬
‭ To support direct application of this taxonomy, we can take terms available in the set listed above‬
‭ to categorizing and improving our understanding around a set of social sectors, on which‬
‭ countless projects around the world are focused.‬
‭ Water Wind Lake Thunder Mountain Fire‬
‭ Blue Yellow Orange Purple Green Red‬
‭ Relations Education Gender Vision Health Arts‬
‭ Media Courses Sexuality Mapping Growth Creativity‬
‭ Comms. Learning Diversity Technology Food Transformation‬
‭ Universal Taxonomy White Paper 11‬
‭ In this example, we give three different term sets which cover a full-spectrum of social impact‬
‭ areas. The terms in each set are deeply inter-related. For example, relations are developed‬
‭ through communications ( comms. above) and expressed through media, while social work‬
‭ around gender focuses on diversity . Mapping systems require technology to provide vision into‬
‭ what is happening and where (a shorthand for data sciences ). The energy behind fire is at the‬
‭ heart of producing things ( forging from above), and which filled with passion this production is‬
‭ expressed as creativity and the arts. Whether food, self-development and growth , or other‬
‭ practical approaches to self- love and integration , these all fall under the umbrella of health .‬
‭ Finally, education is comprised of sequencing learning into intentional experiential processes we‬
‭ often call courses .‬
‭ Expanding Spectra through Temporality and Duality‬
‭ Returning to our binary progression, we recognize that in order to elucidate the dynamics which‬
‭ give rise to the spectra above, we must acknowledge the transcendent polarity from which these‬
‭ dynamics originated. We began our process with two principles, the creative (Yang) and receptive‬
‭ (Yin) .‬
‭ A philosophical approach to physics provides us with the following inquiry: “what is it that we‬
‭ can only receive and never change?” The answer lies in Einstein’s master works on relativity,‬
‭ essentially translated as the temporal term past . Light is traveling to us from every direction, and‬
‭ its distance from us is measured by the time the light takes to travel. Anything at any distance to‬
‭ us is always visibly perceived in a state which has already past , occurring at a prior moment in‬
‭ time. Considering that for most physicists, light is considered the ultimate speed limit, every‬
‭ other sensory perception of objects outside our bodies takes even longer to receive and process.‬
‭ For example, smell requires molecules to travel by air, audible sound waves are much slower‬
‭ than light, and while things must be very close to us to taste or touch, we still receive information‬
‭ about those senses through electrical impulses which travel through our bodies at approximately‬
‭ the speed of light.‬
‭ Let us reverse the philosophical inquiry above to: “what is it that we can only create and always‬
‭ change?” Now the answer is easier to grasp, as we are firmly in a temporal context; the future .‬
‭ Moment by moment, our thoughts and feelings turn into actions which cause effects and change‬
‭ circumstances. Each of our choices become ripples which change the course of our future‬
‭ experience. While this may seem purely metaphysical, there are plenty of literal examples:‬
‭ An individual chooses to take a bus instead of driving to work. The bus takes a different‬
‭ route than the driver would have taken, which avoids an accident which occurs at the‬
‭ exact moment when the driver would have been in a specific location (ascertained‬
‭ Universal Taxonomy White Paper 12‬
‭ through temporal data projection). The choice drastically completely changed the driver’s‬
‭ future circumstances, even though the driver did not know the consequences of the choice‬
‭ they made.‬
‭ This temporal dimension, when added to our spectral taxonomy, provides us with an important‬
‭ contextual framework. When considering how something is categorized, are we considering‬
‭ whether it is temporally limited to the past and cannot be changed, or if it is firmly in the future‬
‭ and potentially malleable based on the momentum of choices and current circumstances?‬
‭ Inclusion in our binary sequence completes the full set of I-Ching trigrams.‬

‭ Building Contextual Spectra Through Conscious Dimensions‬
‭ As the intent of this paper is not to provide a comprehensive taxonomy, but rather a method of‬
‭ unifying taxonomies and categorical systems through a framework of understanding, we will‬
‭ now provide a comprehensive use case and application of our formula.‬
‭ The above stages and sequences reveal an interesting series of patterns in regards to our natural‬
‭ methods of contextualizing language. These patterns resolve to a simple set, where words are‬
‭ considered for their meaning and application within one of the following levels of human‬
‭ consciousness and experience:‬
‭ 1. Physical, Material, Elemental, Gross‬
‭ 2. Emotional, Social, Relational, Etheric‬
‭ 3. Mental, Structural, Systemic, Astral‬
‭ These map to metaphysical planes of consciousness in many traditions (listed as the final term in‬
‭ the subsets above). We postulate that these are naturally emergent levels of consciousness which‬
‭ arise as part of the diversification of forces and expressions of energy in the Universe.‬
‭ Universal Taxonomy White Paper 13‬
‭ The first series to emerge is the Physical , mapped in Stage 5. Let’s now expand our terms to‬
‭ additional applications in categorization of projects and topics of study:‬

‭ It is important to note here that while electricity and the energetic properties of the quantum‬
‭ vacuum are essentially tied to life , humanity’s current interaction with these fields is currently‬
‭ relegated to the Mental / Systemic level, and so we will address energy systems at that level. As‬
‭ the transcendent, this field is also capable of being divided into further spectra, so on the‬
‭ Physical level we will focus on its relevance to Life itself, which relates to all species within the‬
‭ living library of planet Earth and beyond.‬
‭ Universal Taxonomy White Paper 14‬
‭ In addition, our current use of thermodynamics as a primary source of energy also makes Fire a‬
‭ good candidate for categorization of energy production , though when we approach this taxonomy‬
‭ through a more holistic lens of regenerative impact, there are many other issues that take‬
‭ precedence in dealing with the dynamics we associate with Fire at a fundamental semantic level.‬
‭ Other than these niche issues, the interconnection between terms, projects, and Sustainable‬
‭ Development Goals listed in the table above is clear.‬
‭ The second series to emerge is the Emotional / Social , mapped in Stage 6.‬

‭ In exploring terms in this series, it becomes clear that each of these harmonic sectors is an‬
‭ emotional driver for relationship. We need shared communication systems to be in relationship .‬
‭ Through learning from each other we grow and evolve our understanding. Our propagation as a‬
‭ Universal Taxonomy White Paper 15‬
‭ species, as well as many social and psychological issues are centered around our perspectives on‬
‭ gender and sexuality , as well as the honoring of our diversity . Without health and wellness as a‬
‭ part of our social fabric, we can’t cultivate good food or stabilize our social experiences.‬
‭ Transformation is an essential part of any society, and without the arts and new types of‬
‭ expression, people become stagnant and complacent. Finally, an awareness of all these needs and‬
‭ areas leads to a new form of arts and communication which is visionary , our ability to see, map ,‬
‭ and understand data and information through technology and gain new insights .‬
‭ In the I-Ching, the term Thunder is often translated as inspiration . As discussed previously, this‬
‭ is the transcendent element of the sequence, though it may appear to just be another color of the‬
‭ spectrum. In physics, the visible color spectrum is bookended by purple as red enters magenta‬
‭ (towards infrared), and blue enters ultraviolet. We can visibly see this phenomenon when looking‬
‭ at any rainbow in the sky, and occasionally it becomes possible to see one end of the rainbow‬
‭ transition through purple hues and continue directly into a mirror of the spectrum.‬
‭ The third series to emerge is the Mental / Systemic, mapped in Stages 7 & 8. In order to more‬
‭ easily understand some of the binary dynamics between the elements at this stage, we will map‬
‭ them in pairs:‬
