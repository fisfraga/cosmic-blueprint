## Translating Elements

So how do you reconcile two cultures with 5 different Elements?

You have the Druid, Wiccan, Earth Religions:
Fire - Air - Earth - Water - Spirit

And you have Chinese Philosophy:
Fire - Metal - Earth - Water - Wood

1. Identify the differences:

Air - Spirit - Metal - Wood

2. Look at the root symbolism:

Air - Intentionality, focus through breath, air goes forth and moves the water, trees...
Spirit - Encompassing energy, living force, containing all elements and transcends...
Metal - Will, forged from fire and water, metal slices through to carry the mind forth...
Wood - Life, growth, the organic element interweaving through the others...

3. Look at the similarities:

Air - Fire & Water make Air, Intentionality, Wind of the Mind (breath)
Metal - Fire & Water forge Metal, Will is intentional, Sword of Mind
Spirit - Life force that unifes elements...
Wood - Life force that makes air, drinks water, eats earth, and gives to fire...

4. Note the differences:

In the Druid's 5 Element model, Spirit is transcendent of the other Elements...

In the Chinese 5 Element model, Wood is equal to all other Elements...

Druids are referring to actual Physical elemental forms: solid, liquid, gaseous, etc...

Chinese are referring to vibrations of Energy, qualities of Chi (Life-Force)...

5. Reconcile:

If the Chinese are saying that these 5 Elements are qualities of a Chi or Life-Force energy, than the Chi is "transcendent" to the 5 Elements, just like Spirit is transcendent to the 4 Physical Elements in the Druid model. This means that if you look at each of these systems side by side, the Druid model is a 4 Element + 1 Transcendent model of Physical experience, whereas the Chinese model is a 5 Element + 1 Transcendent model of Emotional or Energetic experience.

6. Conclusion:

Druids - 5 System describing Physical experience
Chinese - 6 System describing Subtle, Emotional, or Energetic experience

7. Further Development:

Recognizing the Chinese system with a Spirit (Chi) element allows a clear translation into understanding the full 8 Element Pakua Chinese system. As two of the 8 Elements are Infinite (Heaven - Infinite Yang, Earth - Infinite Yin), the 6 System can now display the actual permutations and interactions between these two Infinite Polarities.

8. Final Model: 

(completed after drawing above, Mountain & Earth switched...also the Will, Love, Mind are referring to each of the transcendent Trinities...final model below...for further translation of Wood to Lake, and Spirit to Thunder, just ask!)

Druid 5
Fire - Air - Earth - Water - Spirit

Chinese 6

Chinese 8
Fire - Wind - Mountain - Water - Lake - Thunder - (Heaven) - (Earth)
