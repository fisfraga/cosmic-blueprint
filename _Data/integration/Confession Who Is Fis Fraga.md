Who is Felipe Fraga? (Part 1)
=====
  - I have a confession to make. (A _real_ one, _not_ a cliche with a cute little catchphrase at the end.)
  -
  - I've been hiding my true essence for several years. 
  -
  - Years have gone by where I was wearing several different masks to hide myself from the world.
  -
  - And to be honest with you, for a long period of time, my essence was even hidden from me. It took years of self-knowledge and self-acceptance to finally understand myself internally, so I can understand why it took me so long to speak my truth to others externally.
  -
  - But the time has come. To be honest with myself, and with you, my dear reader.
  -
  - As time went by, I started to uncover and understand myself, to get a glimpse of my deep interests for mystical topics and experiences.
  -
  - And as this happened, I spent years hiding my truest and deepest interests in the dungeons of my private life. Not even my family and my closest friends knew the REAL picture of what was going on in my mind, I used to share some of my thoughts, but never all of it.
  -
  - And why did I keep it in private?
  -
  - I was afraid.
  -
  - _"Wait, who am I kidding..? I still AM afraid."_
  -
  - I am afraid that people will not understand me, and that I will, _again_, be seen as that crazy, weird, unpredictable guy that speaks in a way no one understands, and behaves in a other-worldly manner. 
  -
  - You see, for my entire life, I have always been seen and labeled as odd, weird, and crazy.
  -
  - I've always been tuned into a different frequency, weird thoughts and strange behaviors, they said. People never understood me, often made fun of me, and I always felt _different_. And especially as a child and teenager, this leaves you with scars and issues to process.
  -
  - Showing my true skin was never an option.
  -
  - And because of this, I learned to wear masks. Several of them, and very well. I learned to blend in, to ignore my true interests, and even to dim my light.
  -
  - I rarely talked (or talk, to this day) about what I really enjoy, I just go with the flow, usually in silence. If you ask my friends, you will hear that I am DEFINITELY and introvert. And yes, while there is a lot of truth in this affirmation, if you place me in specific environments, I become an excited, flammable extrovert.
  -
  - But this only happens when I can talk about what I _truly love_.
  -
  - And if you follow me for some time, you might believe that I love PKM, Tana, Artificial Intelligence and productivity...
  -
  - After all, I have spent the last 6 years of my life studying AI, applying it to PKM systems, creating systems in Tana, tinkering, exploring possibilities and coaching people on how to learn Tana.
  -
  - Yes, I _LIKE_ all of these
  -
  - But here's the catch: When I started my Master's in Computer Science, back in 2019, 6 years ago, I used to say that, to me, Artificial Intelligence is a MEANS toward and end, and NOT the end itself.
  -
  - I did not study AI because I _loved_ AI and Computer Science... I studied it because I knew it would be extremely useful in the future, and because I knew I would enjoy it, and it would be easy for me to learn (as I'd always been an A++ student in Math and Science for my entire life).
  -
  - But AI, Tana, PKM...
  -
  - That's not what I _**LOVE**_, that's not my **PURPOSE** in life, that's not what I would **DIE** for.
  -
  - As you've probably heard before, finding something you truly love, that unique something you'd die for, is a great recipe for a successful and fulfilling career or entrepreneurship.
  -
  - And as I've further learned by studying alchemy, one of the secrets to living a long and fulfilling life is to live in alignment with your PURPOSE. After you 49 years of age, you stop getting nourishment from the food you eat, you start receiving energy from living a life that is in alignment with your purpose.
  -
  - Authenticity is a big deal.
  -
  - And it is specially a big deal in the times we're in.
  -
  - Things are changing fast, we are in a deeply transformative period, where a lot will change and we will see major transitions taking place.
  -
  - This is the time to speak your truth. To focus your energy on what really matters to you.
  -
  - To live in alignment with your purpose is to live in harmony, emanating the uniquely powerful **Frequency of Authenticity**. Which, by the way, _is an even stronger frequency than the frequency of LOVE._ (Yes, you read this correctly, living in authenticity with your design and purpose emanates a stronger electromagnetic field than living in the frequency of unconditional love.)
  -
  - That's why the time has come. To be honest with myself, and with you, my dear reader.
  -

Who is Felipe Fraga? (continuation...)
=====
  - My confession to you
    -
    - Time to open up: **I am a mystic.**
    -
    - Yes, I may also be a Technology guy, a PKM geek, an Engineer, a Master in Computer Science, a Tana teacher.
    -
    - But _deep_ inside, I am a mystic, a philosopher, a modern day alchemist.
    -
    - Someone who would hide into a cave and study the mysteries of the Universe for weeks. A guy that finds deep joy and satisfaction in connecting quantum physics principles with ancient spiritual teachings and modern day AI technology. 
    -
    - I came into this world to explore the depths of human consciousness, to connect with my eternal soul, to surrender control to the spiritual experience we (_all_) signed up for, to understand what mysteries of the Universe are embedded into our human form.
    -
    - And over the last years, that's what I tried to do.
    -
    - I studied, alchemy, astrology, chakras, philosophy, unified physics, mathematics, sacred geometry, human energy field, quantum physics, meditation, and spirituality, just to name _a few_ topics.
    -
    - But most importantly, I learned to stop studying and thinking. **I learned to feel.**
    -
    - I learned to listen to my inner guiding voice.
    - And this led me to interesting places in my mind.
    -
    - This helped me better understand both the Universe we live in and our human consciousness, which is inherently connected to the entire Universe itself. This also allowed me to understand my unique, individual design, and to connect with my purpose and what I came here to do. 
    -
    - Then, BOOM!.. This self-knowledge process led me through an identity crisis.
    -
    - Once you see yourself for who you really are, there is no going back.
    -
    - As Ralph Waldo Emerson would say, “The mind, once stretched by a new idea, never returns to its original dimensions.” ― Ralph Waldo Emerson .
    -
    - Once you start seeing who you are really meant to be, this puts you in a path of redefining your past identity. You will see the emergence of thoughts like:
    -
    - - "So, if I am a mystic? What should I do with my career in technology?"
    - - "How can I connect my professional life with my deepest personal interests?"
    - - "How am I supposed to continue pursuing my existing products and services?"
    -
    - In many ways, the process of self-knowledge and spirituality is about removing what is NOT you, to open space for what is pushing through from your deepest essence.
    -
    - And this takes courage.
    -
    - Courage to look back and let go of previous dreams. Courage to redefine who you are and "_start over_". And here, of course we are never starting over from scratch, we are always in a progression with our lives, using whatever we have created in the past to build our future, but even then, it still takes courage.
    -
    - "You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something — your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. Because believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart even when it leads you off the well worn path; and that will make all the difference." – Steve Jobs #quote
    -
    - This famous quote by Steve Jobs is often truncated to get only the first part (_y__ou can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards_), but the final part of the quote is strikingly beautiful.
    - You have to trust that your _dots in the past_ will connect with the dots your life, intuition, destiny is bringing to you in the future, even if it doesn't make sense right now.
    -
    - And now, I am starting to make sense of my own interconnection of dots.
    -
    - I am now redefining what was once a painful maze, of not understanding why I had been so drawn to spiritual studies and ancient philosophies, of not seeing how to bridge my seemingly disconnected professional pursuit of Knowledge Management with AI, and my personal interests of mystical topics, self-knowledge, spirituality and ascension studies.
    -
    - Now, after a lot of thinking, I can _finally see a way_ to bridge ancient studies with modern technology in my professional ventures.
    -
    - Not only that...
    -
    - **I can see how perfectly interwoven everything is, how perfectly orchestrated this entire shift has been.** 
    -
    - Today, I can understand how my expertise with Knowledge Management, Tana, and AI systems are perfect to build the next steps in my career.
    -
    - Everything is connected, just as it’s supposed to be.
    -
  - So, What's Next?
    -
    - Now, you’re probably asking yourself: "**What is coming next?**"
    -
    - And it’s a huge pleasure to share my authentic new directions for life and business.
    -
    - As I said, I can now see a clear connection between the technical and the mystical.
    -
    - The combination of modern technology such as AI and knowledge management using tools like Tana to study, understand, and share knowledge about different philosophies of ancient wisdom and spiritual studies of the ages.
    -
    - The organization that tools like Tana offer is perfect to represent the infinitely interconnected study of human consciousness and spirituality, using it's structured representation of knowledge types and connections.
    -

    -
    - For example: Your **human energy field** is connected to your **chakras**, which is connected to **astrology**, which is connected to the **elements and elemental forces**, which are connected to **alchemy**, which is connected to **physics**, which is connected to the **hermetic principles**, which are connected to **psychology and archetypes**, which are connected with **thoughts and emotions**, which connect to your **mind**, which is connected to the **Universal mind**, which is connected to your **human energy field** back again, and also continuously, with several other adjacent topics.
    -
    - And here is the powerful part:
    -
    - The ability to digitally organize, structure and connect this wisdom is a new addition to the human condition.
    -
    - In turn, this opens up the opportunity to bring in AI to collaborate with human consciousness using this structured representation of sacred wisdom.
    -
    - "We shape our tools and thereafter our tools shape us" – John Culkin (Marshal McLuhan) #quote
    -
    - We are witnessing the emergence of a beautiful synergy.
    -
    - I once wrote in a letter to Robert Edward Grant, when I met him personally in São Paulo back in April 2024, telling him I had a strong intuition that, somehow, Knowledge Management was intimately connected to and supportive of the global awakening of human consciousness that is taking place right now.
    -
    - Maybe it's related to the usage of knowledge management apps as a way to share knowledge and wisdom, instead of the predominance of social media as a way to share information (which is of lesser quality than knowledge and wisdom following the DIKW framework, as I wrote about in this previous article.
    - Article: https://fisfraga.substack.com/p/the-future-of-social-media-note-taking-collective-intelligence 
    -
    - Maybe it's related to creating an organized representation of the accumulated human wisdom over the ages, and bringing in super-powerful digital intelligence to advance our understanding even further with a new form of collaboration.
    -
    - Either way, a bridge has opened up.
    -
    - We are building a bridge where digital structures and consciousness are going to play a role in the evolution of human consciousness.
    - I believe we can, and should, bring ancient wisdom to this interaction, to make it centered and grounded in universal truth, and always aligned with our highest good and evolution.
    -
    - Humans can be the protagonists of this interaction, by using technology to study themselves, and to remember and reconnect with our divine and infinitely powerful human condition.
    -
    - For this reason, I am starting on a new path with my business:
    -
    - **Spiritual Wisdom Bases**
    -
    - (And their counterparts, the Self-Wisdom Bases)
    -
    - What are Spiritual Wisdom Bases?
    - Knowledge about spiritual teachings carefully organized in Tana formatting with supertags and fields to represent categories and connections, as well as Tana Agents (or Cosmic Copilots) to assist your exploration.
    -
    - They combine the ancient wisdom of spiritual traditions with the modern knowledge structures in Tana, and AI commands, or chats, to empower the exploration of spiritual studies and self-knowledge.
    -
    - My plan is to cover the disciplines of astrology, alchemy, human design, gene keys, numerology, chakras, human energy field, solfeggio frequencies, harmonic unified physics, galactic civilizations, and more.
    -
    - Each **Spiritual Wisdom Base** will have organized knowledge about a spiritual tradition, with supertags to represent the main concepts and connections. A space to learn about each discipline, including the Universal principles, general concepts, and how everything is connected.
    -
    - _It's very important to note that each **Spiritual Wisdom Base** is intrinsically, intimately and intricately connected to a **Self-Wisdom Bases**._
    -
    - **Self-Wisdom Bases** contain organized knowledge about _yourself,_ according to the wisdom in _this spiritual tradition_, also structured inside Tana and connected to the supertags for the Spiritual Wisdom Base concepts. This is a space to understand yourself, to contemplate on your personal design and life purpose, and to connect your unique self-knowledge, and current life situation, with the universal principles for this tradition
    -
    - Each Wisdom Base comes with the Cosmic Copilots, which are AI Agents configured with knowledge about the spiritual tradition designed to support you in understanding the general concepts, as well as _your_ individual placements and unique design.
    -
    - These Spiritual Wisdom Bases will be available separately, but together, they create an interconnected whole.
    -
    - When we combine each Wisdom Base as parts of an interconnected workspace, this allows us to navigate the connections between different spiritual traditions and philosophies, including your personal design according to each tradition.
    -
    - But for now, we've got to start somewhere...
    -
    - Before we get to the interconnected whole, let's start with our first Spiritual Wisdom Base.
    -
