- Summary
  - Life's Work - 32
    - With this Gift as your Life's Work, you need to feel part of a broader pattern. Support from those you trust is one of the great keys in your life. Above all, you need to find what it is that you want to preserve for future generations. If you are raising a family, it is far more important for you to give your children high principles and a feeling of respect for life, than it is to give them financial freedom or economic support. You have a deep and natural instinct for long-term investments, especially in terms of where you put your own energy. If you can expand your horizons to encompass the whole planet, you will find greater fulfilment and, in the long term, greater financial return through the karma you accrue.
  - Evolution - 42
    - With this Gift as your Evolution, you have a challenge in life to finish what you have begun. Not only must you finish what you have begun, but you must finish it cleanly, which means to say that you have to let it go. Endings may be challenging for you, but they are also very beautiful. They give you the opportunity to begin another journey. The trick for you is to make sure that each new beginning has its root in the old ending. In other words, there is great continuity to everything that happens to you in life. The only danger you have is breaking out of patterns too early or hanging on to patterns too long. If you break the pattern too soon, you have to begin all over again with the same pattern until it is finished with you, rather than you thinking that you can finish it! On the other hand, if you hang on to things too long, you break the continuity that leads to the next organic unfolding in your life. The most important thing for you is to let life live through you, and enjoy every experience without trying to exert too much control.
  - Radiance - 56
    - With the 56th Gift governing your health, you need to travel in order to maintain optimum health. Travelling does not mean literally moving from place to place, although this will always be important for you. Travelling for you means to travel through different experiences with different people, learning and sharing different things, rather than being stuck with the same old people in the same old place, doing the same old thing! Your other great gift is the ability to divert others away from their suffering — although you never do this from a place of denial of suffering. You simply have a knack of putting things into a different perspective. Your health and wellbeing depend on your ability to sustain this humorous perspective. There is nothing healthier for you than true laughter.
  - Purpose - 60
    - You will never find your purpose in the past or the future. For you, purpose is always in the here and now. However you feel, whatever you are doing, that is your purpose. The worst thing for you is to ponder the purpose of your life! If you are feeling low, then your purpose lies within that feeling. If you are high and life is bursting with potential, then your purpose is being expressed through your creativity. You are a leaf on the wind — your life does not belong to you but to the stars and the tides and the music of nature. You are an artist and life is your easel. You are a poet and life is your poem. You are the structure, and you have to let life play through you without judging or controlling the music that emerges. There is nothing that you can do or say that will change life, so you may as well just learn to love it and breathe it in every waking moment.

      - Explanation
        - Our journey begins right away with a confrontation. In the Gene Keys, the central premise is that every Shadow contains a Gift, so we must begin by looking into the nature of the Shadows within us in order to get to the hidden Gift inside. This is your Challenge. As you learn more about the nature of Challenge in your life as a cosmic theme, you can apply this as a backdrop to the first Gene Key of your Activation Sequence – **the Gene Key of your Life’s Work. **This may also be your first introduction to the six lines and how to apply them to the Gene Keys.

      - **Contemplation**
        - **Intro**
          - The specific words for the 64 Gene Keys are a set of linguistic keys. You may not at first understand them, but in time you may discover the stories, insights and vibrations that lie behind the words. One of your greatest allies in this journey will be patience.
        - **The Sphere of Your Life’s Work**
          - You can begin by contemplating the Gene Key that represents your Life’s Work. Your Life’s Work is the tip of the iceberg of your entire profile. It is where your deeper purpose meets the outside world. There are many forms of work. Your outer work is one thing – what you are here to do in life – that is your career, job or daily role. This Gene Key is a good indicator of what you may be best suited to in the world. However, the Gene Keys are not literal. Rather they give you the frame of a storyline, and it is you who must fit this into an external role in your life. When you look at the Shadow of this Gene Key, you will see the pattern in your nature that prevents you from finding the kind of role that perfectly suits you.
        - **The Shadow**
          - The other kind of work is inner work. The Shadow of your Life’s Work really shows you a challenge that you will meet over and over again in your life until you have fully accepted it. This is your inner Life’s Work. There are essentially three phases that accompany the transformation of our Shadows. They are: Allow, Accept and Embrace. First you must begin to allow that this issue is in your life. You don’t have to accept it right away. You may hate it, shy away from it or be enraged by it. But you must begin simply by allowing it to be there. And it may not be there all the time. You will have to watch for it. Once you have allowed it you are ready to accept it, and acceptance is a beautiful thing. Acceptance means that your inner work is really kicking in. You have summoned the courage to take responsibility for something inside yourself. Acceptance sparks the fire of transformation and as the fire reddens around you, the final phase comes into play – the embrace. You take a deep breath and you let the Shadow in all the way. Only this totality allows a negative pattern to be fully transformed inside you. It is you fully opening your heart to the challenge of your life.
        - **The Gift**
          - Every Shadow contains a Gift. And this process of transformation takes time. We should be clear about this. You don’t just transform this challenge and then move on to the next part of your Profile! This Challenge is there all the way along the journey. It is your primary challenge. As you continue to explore the inner reaches of your Hologenetic Profle, you will see how your embracing of this Pathway of Challenge opens up all the other doorways in your Profile, and there are other deeper Shadows lurking in there. But these in turn contain further Gifts. Every time you recognise a negative pattern and embrace it, you unlock another Gift. Ultimately each Gift is interrelated, just as each Shadow is interrelated. Your ongoing contemplation will reveal this to you. As the Gift comes out, so your Life’s Work becomes clearer. Your inner work affects your outer work. This is a universal law.
        - **The Siddhi**
          - The Siddhi represents the Divine essence of your work in the world. As you contemplate the Shadow of your Life’s Work, it is a good idea to counterbalance it by holding the Siddhi in mind and heart. You need to really consider this Siddhi and locate it as an essence inside yourself. It is what you are here to do. It is the essence of your biography. When your journey of contemplation brings you to the end of this Golden Path, you will return once more to this same Gene Key, but in another completely different octave. You need to hold this Siddhi in your heart throughout the journey, and by the end, if you are fortunate, it may have revealed itself to you in some form.
        - **Contemplating your Gene Key**
          - **Listen to the audio contemplation for your Life’s Work Gene Key included above**
          - **Read the chapter on your Gene Key from <a href="https://genekeys.com/product/the-gene-keys-paperback/">“Gene Keys: Embracing Your Higher Purpose”</a>**
          - ****As you contemplate the Sphere of your Life’s Work, you can also consider the following questions:**
          - **Do you have a sense of what your Life’s Work might be?**
          - **How might you relate your Life’s Work to what you are currently doing in your life?**
          - **How does it feel when you read about your Life’s Work?** **Be honest with yourself!**
        - **Contemplating the Life’s Work**
          - Now you have absorbed the knowledge above, here are three questions for your Contemplation:
          - ****What is the most important insight, great or small, that you have learned from contemplating the Gene Key and line key of your Life’s Work?**
          - **How does the shadow of your Life’s Work Gene Key prevent you from expressing your gift?**
          - **What inspires you about the Siddhi of your Life’s Work?**

    - All Sphere Lines:: 
      - Lines
        - **Contemplating The 6 Lines** 
          - In the introduction to the Golden Path, we used the analogy of music to help understand the relationship between each Gene Key and its six lines. We said that if each Gene Key were a melody, then each line was like a key in which that melody could be played. In your Hologenetic Profle, you have a whole string of Gene Keys that relate to aspects of your consciousness, and each Gene Key comes with a specific line activation. A major part of your contemplation practise will be to unlock the inner meaning of your Gene Key and its line, in the context of its position within the overall sequence. Your Golden Path holds a potent storyline for the unfolding of your consciousness and the 6 lines provide an important part of your inner narrative. Their meanings are explored below.
          - **Life’s Work Line Keynotes**
          - _All six lines have been provided below for your reference. If you are new to these teachings, you. may want to begin only by reading your own line and contemplating it deeply. Over time, you may find it beneficial to read all six lines to have a more holistic understanding of how they interact within yourself, your relationships, and the world around you._
        - **Line 1 – The Creator** 
          - The 1st line of each Gene Key really expresses the inner essence of the archetype that it contains. We humans are here to be creative. Our Life’s Work is essentially a creative work in process. When we finish our Life’s Work and return to the void, someone else steps in to continue our work, whatever it may be, and so the chain of creative evolution continues. If you have a 1st line as your Life’s Work then you are here to create something new. It has to be your idea – it has to be something that emerges from deep inside you. You can ride on the shoulders of other creators who have come before you, but still, your version must be an original. When you apply this line to your Life’s Work Gene Key, you need to consider that Gene Key at a very deep level. Your contemplation must take you right to the bottom of the well. There is a great depth in you wanting to find expression in the world. You may need a lot of courage and patience to find and express yourself fully in your work. Whatever you do, it must have this vital creative element within it, otherwise you will never be able to feel fulfilled in your life.
          - **Higher Service Keynote:** Stabilising
          - _You are here to change the way people breathe._
        - **Line 2 – The Dancer** 
          - Every 2nd line carries a strong feeling of fluidity in it. Whereas the 1st line is about digging down deep to unearth the creative fruits, the 2nd line is all about self-expression. At its best the 2nd line is also unselfconscious, like the dancer who becomes lost in the joy of the dance. If you have a 2nd line as your Life’s Work, then you will have to find out the gifts in life that come to you naturally and easily. Early on in our lives it often becomes clear at school for example, which subjects we are best at, although we often end up being drawn down different paths. You need to do the things you are best at – the things you love – the things you can do without even thinking. The archetype of the dancer refers to an inherent natural gift that emanates from you. When you trust in this gift, it just flows out of you with a beautiful, natural unstudied air. When you contemplate the Gene Key of your Life’s Work, think about the thing you do with the most grace and ease. This will give you a clue as to where your true Life’s Work lies.
          - **Higher Service Keynote:** Gliding
          - _You are here to change the way people move._
        - **Line 3 – The Changer** 
          - Unlike the 2nd line that follows a clear inner flow out into the world, the 3rd line is far less predictable. All 3rd lines have change at their heart. They do not often manifest the kind of stability that the other lines have. This means that the lives of those with 3rd lines are often very colourful, or when viewed from the Shadow, chaotic. If you have a 3rd line for your Life’s Work, your great challenge is to learn to let go of what your mind thinks is ‘normal’. Your archetype is the Changer, which means that you will learn your Gifts from life. You may have many different experiences in different roles, with different people coming in and out of your life, and if you can let go and enjoy this kind of exciting narrative, then you will lead a very rich life. If however, you compare your life to others who may seem more stable, you may end up harbouring all manner of self-judgements that will undermine your true Gifts. When you contemplate the Gene Key of your Life’s Work, you need to imagine it in its most dynamic, changing, adaptable form, and that will bring you closer to the essence of your Life’s Work.
          - **Higher Service Keynote:** Leaping
          - _You are here to change the way people feel about themselves._
        - **Line 4 – The Server** 
          - Of all the 6 lines, the 4th line has the capacity to be the most focussed. When you apply this line to the Gene Key of your Life’s Work, it can create a very powerful, influential Gift. If you have the 4th line as your Life’s Work, it colours the corresponding Gene Key with an incredible capacity for conviction. You have an innate ability to influence other people. Depending on your attitude, this can either push people away or draw them towards you. The realm of the 4th line is people, so it is important that you learn to listen to others. Whatever your Life’s Work Gene Key, its healthiest expression is through service. For you, service can mean many things – it can for instance be about quality, refinement or courtesy, or it can be as obvious as being in a service profession. The Server is an archetype that clearly involves the giving of your Gifts for the sake of others. In other words, you are really in it because you love to see someone else smile.
          - **Higher Service Keynote:** Flooding
          - _You are here to change the way people feel about others._
        - **Line 5 – The Fixer** 
          - There is a clear narrative flow through all the 6 lines. The 1st line discovers it, the 2nd line expresses it, the 3rd line experiments with it and adapts it, the 4th line spreads it, and then we come to the 5th line. The 5th line is pure practicality. It looks at the thing and decides whether it is going to really help the world or not. If it isn’t then the 5th line just looks away, but if there is a chance that this thing may really be of use, then the 5th line will claim ownership of it and make something really powerful of it. If you have the 5th line for your Life’s Work, then you have the capacity to go far in the outer world. The archetype of the fixer is about creating greater efficiency in the world. When you contemplate the Gene Key of your Life’s Work, think about how you could make a business out of this archetype. Think about how you could use that as a leader. It doesn’t mean you have to do that, but it allows your mind to function in the way nature intended. Your Gifts, when well organised, are needed by many people. Of all the 6 lines, you have perhaps the greatest capacity to be outwardly successful in the world through your Gifts.
          - **Higher Service Keynote:** Radiating
          - _You are here to change the way people behave._
        - **Line 6 – The Teacher** 
          - The 6th line stands apart from the other lines. In a sense it lives according to different laws. This doesn’t make it any better or worse, as each line has its advantages. The question that beats at the heart of all 6th lines is why? The 6th line has a certain relationship to the 1st line, as it brings completion to the whole spectrum of wisdom contained within each Gene Key. The 1st line holds the essence of the Gene Key and the 6th line writes its autobiography! In other words, the 6th line has the capacity to be the wisest of all the lines – not the smartest (1), not the most attractive (2), not the most exciting (3), not the most approachable (4), not the most successful (5) but the one that simply sees further than the others. This is the archetype of the Teacher, and as we have seen, this doesn’t necessarily mean that if you have a 6th line for your Life’s Work then you are destined to be a teacher. It means that you share the essential attribute of any really good teacher – you understand that people are all born with different gifts, and if you provide the right environment, then those gifts will always emerge on their own.
          - If you have the 6th line for the Gene Key of your Life’s Work, then your contemplation of that Gene Key needs to be rooted in patience. In a way, you have to understand each of the approaches of the other 5 lines before you can answer the question why? The depth of this question means that your Gifts may take a long time to fully emerge in life. You have to be able to look back on your life and then you will begin to see through the eyes of wisdom. Contemplation is therefore a very natural path for you in life. It takes time, but in time, it always yields an answer.

    - Explanation:: 
      - Explanation
        - As you come to the **Sphere of your Evolution** so you will complete the first Pathway of the Golden Path. Understanding the forces that drive you to evolve can be very revealing, especially when you can see the dynamic between the 2 Gene Keys that straddle this Pathway of Challenge. These are known as ‘Programming Partners’ and they either serve as a trap that keeps you a victim of the lower frequencies, or they can be used as a dynamic opportunity to live a creative and inspirational life. In this Step it is important that you grasp this nexus of genetic forces and its capacity to propel you towards your genius.
        - The other essential element to realise at this stage is the holographic nature of your Profile. It is ‘holo-genetic’ because it reveals a natural sequence of awakening that unfolds as you contemplate it. Like a hologram this primary Pathway of Challenge contains every single one of the Pathways to follow. If you went no further than this in your contemplation and gave yourself 100% to embodying the higher attributes of this Pathway, it would be enough to trigger the unfolding of your awakening. Therefore the importance of these Gene Keys cannot be overstated. It is also intriguing to think that as you continue to tread the Golden Path, you may have insights that relate back to this point bringing greater insight to these 2 Gene Keys of your Life’s Work and Evolution.
        - With this Gift as your Evolution, you have a challenge in life to finish what you have begun. Not only must you finish what you have begun, but you must finish it cleanly, which means to say that you have to let it go. Endings may be challenging for you, but they are also very beautiful. They give you the opportunity to begin another journey. The trick for you is to make sure that each new beginning has its root in the old ending. In other words, there is great continuity to everything that happens to you in life. The only danger you have is breaking out of patterns too early or hanging on to patterns too long. If you break the pattern too soon, you have to begin all over again with the same pattern until it is finished with you, rather than you thinking that you can finish it! On the other hand, if you hang on to things too long, you break the continuity that leads to the next organic unfolding in your life. The most important thing for you is to let life live through you, and enjoy every experience without trying to exert too much control.<a href="https://genekeys.com/c/the-activation-sequence/lessons/the-sphere-of-evolution/topic/your-evolution/#"></a>

    - Line:: 
      - **Line 5 – Power And Projection** 
        - The 5th line Evolution is all about the projection and use of power. As a 5th line you have a built-in ‘X factor’ – a kind of mystique that emerges through your aura. This is not something that you can do anything about because it is uncultivated. Therefore you have to be very aware of the profound effect you have on others. People will naturally be drawn to you, no matter what you stand for. At the Shadow frequencies this almost always ends in disappointment, both for you and others. Unless you are aware of your power you are likely to be misinterpreted by others, so one of the most important things for you is to learn how and when to express yourself. When you are passionate about something you can be captivating to others and they may harbour all kinds of hidden projections about you that have no foundation in reality. What this means is that the 5th line has to learn about personal and professional boundaries. When you express yourself with economy and clarity you minimise the risk of misunderstanding. When considering the Gene Key of your Evolution think about how easily others could misunderstand this great gift. Then you will be able to take full advantage of your 5th line projection field.

      - Contemplation
        - **Intro**
          - Perhaps you have some inkling of the meaning of your Life’s Work from your initial contemplation. Perhaps it still seems a mystery to you. Either is fine. This process of understanding takes time. You can keep returning in your contemplation to aspects of your Profile that do not quite make sense to you. You can trust in the process of Self-Illumination. As you continue to mull things over, sooner or later you will attain clarity. We will now turn our lens to the next Sphere along the Golden Path – the Sphere of Evolution. Your Evolution, as we have seen, is in opposition to your Life’s Work. Together, these two spheres and their Gene Keys encapsulate the primary challenge of your life. Look deeply then into the Gene Key of your Evolution. It will very likely represent an uncomfortable place for you.
        - **The Shadow** 
          - It is essential that you fully understand the Shadow frequency of the Gene Key relating to your Evolution. Until you come to see it playing out in your life and begin the process of coming to terms with it, your Activation Sequence will remain dormant. There are several trigger points along the Golden Path and your Evolution is the first. If you don’t understand the meaning of this Shadow or it doesn’t seem to connect with you, then you may need to consider it again from another angle. Sometimes the words for the Gene Keys have more than one meaning. It is also one thing to intellectually grasp a pattern, but quite another to catch it in the present moment.
          - Often these patterns emerge in the mirror of our relationships, and often they have become a part of our behaviour or they motivate our behaviour. One thing is certain, the moment you experience uncertainty or pain, this Shadow will be close by. You can make that your first project – wait until you next experience a challenge – it can be inner or outer – and then be vigilant for this Shadow. Once you have encountered it, you will most likely know it very well.
        - **The Gift** 
          - Treading the Golden Path may not be the easiest thing you attempt in life, but it is well worth the effort. Your first challenge is to understand your challenge! When you contemplate these two Programming Partners – your Life’s Work and your Evolution together, you may begin to see how entrenched is that challenge. However your Evolution is not about getting past this challenge because it is the discomfort that shows us that we are growing. The secret is to learn to appreciate your specific challenge in life. Your Gifts, that is your genius, grow out of the compost of these Shadow patterns and it is your awareness that transforms them. Take a good look at the Gift of your Evolution and you may see a quality that sets you apart from others. There are only 64 Gene Keys so there will be many people with this same Gene Key for their Evolution, but when you add in each of the nuances along the rest of your Golden Path you will have begun to decipher the story of your destiny. The Gift is what emerges as you change your whole attitude to life by not allowing yourself to behave as though you were a victim. In addition to this, your Evolutionary Gift grounds you in your physical body. It is a great leveler as it makes you feel an equal with every other human being. We all come into the world with a challenge, and our willingness to embrace that challenge determines the strength of our spirit.
        - **The Siddhi** 
          - It is important to consider these Programming Partners – the 2 Gene Keys of your Life’s Work and your Evolution – as a single field of consciousness that dictates your genius. You can consider the Shadows, the Gifts and the Siddhis of all the Programming Partners like that. When you come to the Siddhi, this quality denotes the potential expression of your life as a fully realised, enlightened human being. In the Gene Keys, we hold an inner image of the Siddhis as a counter to our Shadows. The Siddhis are not a promise, and we also need to be careful of being caught up in the trap of hope. If you hope for these qualities, you are subtly playing into the game of being a victim. The Siddhi of your Evolution is an essence inside you. It fuels the essence of what you are here to do in life. It is a special dispensation you were gifted with at birth, and at times in your life it will come to the fore. The deeper you accept the Shadow patterns, the humbler you will feel on the inside because the Siddhis arise out of intense feelings of gratitude. They well up at key points in our life, and the challenges we face can bring forth those precious moments when we glimpse the truth of what we are.

    - All Sphere Lines:: 
      - **Evolution Line Keynotes**
        - **Line 1 – Self And Empowerment**
          - In the sphere of one’s Life’s Work, the 1st line is keynoted ‘the Creator’. In the sphere of one’s Evolution, this becomes all about the empowerment of the Self. Your Activation Sequence is about discovering your genius in life, regardless of which line you have activated. If you have a 1st line Evolution then your primary challenge is always likely to be about how self-assured or inadequate you feel. As a creative type you may sometimes feel you are your own worst enemy. Yours is a private path. That doesn’t mean you cannot seek outside help and support, but it does suggest that the answers need to come from inside you. The arc of your evolution depends upon you digging deeply into your own aloneness and finding sustenance in there. No one else can empower you or dis-empower you. You can only do these things for yourself. When you meet this challenge courageously, then your Gifts will always empower others to find the same inner strength inside them. This is something to contemplate alongside the Gene Key of your Evolution.
          - **Line Theme:** Sourced from Within
          - **Deep Dive Shadow Keynote:** Self-Esteem
          - **Circuit Breaker:** Break out of self-centered philosophy through service to others.
        - **Line 2 – Passion And Relationships** 
          - Whereas the 1st line contains the secret essence of the Gene Key, the 2nd line is all about expressing this essence. If the 1st line were a seed, then the 2nd line would represent the sapling.The 2nd line therefore has a very different set of challenges. This is about the uninhibited expression of energy as passion, and passion always catches the eye of others. When you contemplate the Gene Key of your Evolution, imagine how you might express these qualities with passion. Imagine the Shadow expressed through anger, without realisation of the consequences. This may well tell the story of some of your relationship difficulties in life. The 2nd line always learns most intensely through a relationship. The dilemma and the beauty of the 2nd line as a life theme is that its nature is to be unselfconscious. At the Gift and Siddhi frequency this emerges gracefully and has enormous beneficial impact, but at the Shadow frequency it is disastrous. Negative energy expressed unselfconsciously, whether through actions or words, is always destructive. If you therefore have a 2nd line theme as your Life’s Work and Evolution, your challenge is to listen to and observe the feedback from those closest to you. They always provide a very clear mirror of the frequency moving through you. Eventually, you will become so attuned to your environment that you will stop yourself before a negative pattern is even expressed. Then your true passion will emerge innocently and be met with acceptance and gratitude.
          - **Line Theme:** Unselfconsciousness
          - **Deep Dive Shadow Keynote:** Projection
          - **Circuit Breaker:** Break out of disappointment through finding fulfillment inside yourself.
        - **Line 3 – Energy And Experience** 
          - You may recall that the 3rd line is all about change. When you are contemplating a 3rd line Evolution, you need to look at this Gene Key as a journey. How will you spend this genetic inheritance you have been gifted? For you life is all about the experience rather than the result. Whether an endeavour appears to succeed or fail, it’s all about the journey and the experience that you have learned through it. Let’s look at the 56th Gene Key with its Shadow of Distraction and Gift of Enrichment as an example. If we were contemplating a 1st line theme here it would be all about being distracted by inner issues inside oneself, for example fears and/or obsessions. If it were a 2nd line, the distraction would be relationships, and if it were a 3rd line, it would be experiences. So you might be the kind of person who is drawn to one experience after another as a distraction from that which really enriches your spirit. When you finally let go of the idea that you are going to get something from all those experiences, then you begin to realise that you have actually learned a great deal along the way. Then you can use your experiences (good and bad) to enrich others, and this becomes your Gift. When you apply the lines to the Gene Keys in this way, the story of your life often comes into new perspective.
          - **Line Theme:** Enrichment
          - **Deep Dive Shadow Keynote:** Avoidance
          - **Circuit Breaker:** Break out of need for attention/approval by doing things without agenda.
        - **Line 4 – Love And Community** 
          - With a 4th Line Evolution, your life’s great challenge is likely to be about finding a balance between being alone and being with others. How will you combine your need to be of service with your need to have space? At the Shadow frequencies the 4th line has a tendency to simply go to one extreme or the other and then either collapse from exhaustion or end up being cut off from others.
          - With the 4th line the theme is always love – the love of being with friends and the love of one’s own company. In a rich life, love flows freely between these two poles in a natural and easy rhythm. As a 4th line, you might like to view the Gene Key of your Evolution as a quality designed to be shared with others. The more you share your Gift, the more you feed yourself and the more influential you become. The gift of the 4th line is to touch people’s hearts and bring them over to one’s point of view, so long as it is the most ethical point of view. Of all the 6 lines, you are the one most equipped to convince others of the importance of a heart-based approach to any situation. In addition to this, your 4th line perspective is adept at communication, which makes you a powerful force in any community or business.
          - **Line Theme:** Harmony
          - **Deep Dive Shadow Keynote:** Comparison
          - **Circuit Breaker:** Break out of anxiety by admitting your issues are tiny – give into your big love.
        - **Line 5 – Power And Projection** 
          - The 5th line Evolution is all about the projection and use of power. As a 5th line you have a built-in ‘X factor’ – a kind of mystique that emerges through your aura. This is not something that you can do anything about because it is uncultivated. Therefore you have to be very aware of the profound effect you have on others. People will naturally be drawn to you, no matter what you stand for. At the Shadow frequencies this almost always ends in disappointment, both for you and others. Unless you are aware of your power you are likely to be misinterpreted by others, so one of the most important things for you is to learn how and when to express yourself. When you are passionate about something you can be captivating to others and they may harbour all kinds of hidden projections about you that have no foundation in reality. What this means is that the 5th line has to learn about personal and professional boundaries. When you express yourself with economy and clarity you minimise the risk of misunderstanding. When considering the Gene Key of your Evolution think about how easily others could misunderstand this great gift. Then you will be able to take full advantage of your 5th line projection field.
          - **Line Theme:** Amplification
          - **Deep Dive Shadow Keynote:** Pressure
          - **Circuit Breaker:** Break out of misunderstandings by using vulnerability as a strength.
        - **Line 6 – Education And Surrender** 
          - The 6th line lives out a very rich narrative over the course of its life. Unlike any of the other lines it moves through the whole story of the lines in a single lifetime! For the 6th line there is so much to learn before one’s dreams can come true. In addition, by the time you have matured enough in wisdom, your understanding of your own dreams will have changed. This is why surrender is one of the keynotes of the6th line Evolution. You will need to learn to trust in the fates. When you apply the 6th line theme to the Gene Key of your Evolution, it may help to look at it as a maturing quality. The 6th line is all about the long-term view. This is why education is such an important part of your life. Through your own experience you will learn that life knows best in the end, and it is this trust in life that you can eventually bring into the world as a role model. Education does not impose views – rather it draws out that which is already inside. This 6th line adds a quality to any Gene Key that lends it a great kudos in the world. This is something deeper than success or influence in the world. It has more to do with investment in a greater future for us all. In this sense the 6th line is willing to sacrifice personal goals for a wider, collective goal, and even one that will not mature until long after one’s own lifetime.
          - **Line Theme:** Aspiration
          - **Deep Dive Shadow Keynote:** Seeking Resolution
          - **Circuit Breaker:** Break out of compromise by believing in the big dream: we can evolve

  - Pathway of Challenge #[[personal activation pathway]]
    - Explanation:: The first Pathway we come to is the Pathway of Challenge. As you might imagine, this contemplation is therefore about how you tend to deal with difficulties in life. Do you fall victim to your challenges or do you see them for what they are – opportunities for growth and self-illumination?
    - Meditation::  ![Pathway of Challenge Meditation](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/tagr-prod.appspot.com/o/notespace%2Flipefraga%40gmail.com%2Fuploads%2F2024-12-28T05%3A45%3A46.883Z-Chellenge%2BMeditation%2B1.mp3?alt=media&token=e136fb28-c2ea-4a3f-96a0-1f2f86cd6346) 
    - **The Pathway of Challenge**
      - In the Gene Keys, the central premise is that every Shadow contains a Gift, so we must begin by looking into the nature of the Shadows within us in order to get to the hidden Gift inside. This is your Challenge. It is the challenge that rings out inside every human being. Our lives are made or broken upon the back of this primal, archetypal challenge. When you come to the Gene Keys, you must be prepared for a certain level of inner discomfort, because to look into your Shadows and to become more aware of them in your daily life is what this work is all about. In looking at your Challenge, you must look deeply into the dynamic between the 2 Gene Keys that straddle this Pathway. These are the two spheres of your Life’s Work and your Evolution.
      - **Programming Partners**
        - **An Allegory of Consciousness**
        - We are all here to evolve. It is written into the story of DNA that it must evolve in order to survive, and it must evolve even further in order to thrive. The two Gene Keys of your Life’s Work and your Evolution are a genetic pairing, as are the two Gene Keys of your Radiance and Purpose. Of the three sequences of Gene Keys that make up this Golden Path, the Activation Sequence is unique in this respect. It consists of 2 pairs of opposites. In the language of the Gene Keys they are known as Programming Partners. When you look at the Gene Keys Hexagram Wheel below you will see that every Gene Key has another Gene Key exactly opposite from it. If you look at the structure of the 6 lines that make up those 2 hexagrams, you will see that they form the exact mirror pattern of each other. In the Gene Keys Synthesis we use this wheel as a means to locate moments of imprinting, for instance the time of one’s birth. 
        - Your Hologenetic Profile is calculated from the time and place of your birth and in particular from the position of the sun when you were born. And opposite the sun we find the earth, the place from which we look up into the heavens to locate our place in the space-time continuum. It is this polarity that we come into the world with, and they are known as your Life’s Work and your Evolution. Your Life’s Work is dictated symbolically by the sun, the yang force of energy, and your Evolution is dictated symbolically by the earth, the yin force of matter. Whereas your Life’s Work is the expression of what you do, your Evolution is the turbine that drives what you do. The earthbound sphere of your Evolution tugging against that solar fire of your Life’s Work is what sets up the basic tension that writes the script of your life.
        - All of the above can be understood as an allegory of how consciousness comes into the world. We are each an interplay of opposites – the seed from our father’s line and the egg from our mother’s line. When we convert this into the I Ching hexagram wheel, we have a beautiful timeless code to help us decipher the many myths that make up human destiny.
        - When you read the definition of the Programming Partners in the Glossary (below) you can see that the 2 sets of Programming Partners that form your Activation Sequence represent mutually bonded codes buried deep within your DNA. The moment your awareness of the Shadow pattern unlocks these codes, an awakening event occurs as the stored tension of these oppositions is released inside you. This is why the very first pathway of the Golden Path is called the Pathway of Challenge – you have to dive right into the heart of that tension and release it at its core.
        - **Programming Partners**
        - Two Gene Keys that are holographically bonded together through opposition — in other words, they are exact mirror opposites. There are 32 such programming partners within the genetic matrix, and each creates a biofeedback loop that reinforces the themes of those Gene Keys at every level of frequency. At the Shadow frequency, the programming partners create physical, emotional and mental patterns and complexes that mutually reinforce each other. As awareness penetrates these patterns and transforms them, they release waves of creative energy at the Gift frequency, which in turn are mutually reinforced, leading to a continual raising of one’s evolutionary frequency. At the Siddhic frequency, the programming partners no longer oppose each other but dawn as pure consciousness, creating a harmonic so pure that it deletes their difference.

- Pearl Sequence
  - Summary
    -
  - Introduction
    - **The Pearl Sequence**
      - Welcome to the Pearl teachings. As an integral part of the Golden Path series, the Pearl shows you how to apply the Gene Keys, both internally and externally, to your everyday and working life. It is a profound contemplation of the true nature of prosperity, and it may radically change the way you view money and perhaps even what you are here to do in this life. In this programme, we will journey through your Pearl Sequence, a personalised map of how you are designed to prosper in life.
    - **Bringing Contemplation into Action** 
      - The Pearl is all about transforming contemplation into action. Although the Golden Path voyage is an inner journey of awakening, it is also designed to bring about an outer transformation as you learn to apply the teachings to your everyday life, and in particular to your working life or vocation. The three golden questions that ring out over and over again through your Pearl Sequence are:
      - **THREE GOLDEN QUESTIONS**
        - ******What is essential to you in this life?**
        - **What do you want to spend the lion’s share of your precious time doing? **
        - **What is the greatest service I can offer the whole?**
      - We hope you enjoy the teachings of the Pearl, and that they will make a positive difference in your life. As with all our Gene Keys courses and programmes, you are advised to take your time and allow the wisdom of the Gene Keys to unfold in their own mysterious timing. The central technique at the core of these teachings is the art of contemplation, which demands patience and a sense of deep relaxation.
      - **_Contemplation is not a fast art. It is a wonderful, deep, lustrous, slow burn._**
    - Introduction Video Notes
      - Hive Mind is connected to Tana.
      - The network of humans connected through a knowledge synthesis system that represents the collective wisdom.
      - Individual awakening is connected to collective awakening through Tana (in my case, and of my clients).
      - Prosperity through Simplicity is the key.
    - Liberating your Prosperity
      - Take your time reading and absorbing the text below. There are a lot of concepts to weave together. Use your Notes function and stop regularly to follow your own creative responses.
      - **Introduction**
        - Welcome to Part 3 of the Golden Path – the Pearl. The Pearl brings the whole Golden Path to a glowing crescendo of consciousness. It is both a revelation and a conclusion. Your commitment to this path of contemplation shows that you have within you the capacity to embody these teachings at the deepest level. When we come to the Pearl, we will discover some final extraordinary twists in the tale of human consciousness. Here we will enter into the domain of the miraculous. We will invoke the possibilities of our common future – of a newly arising communal awareness that can bridge these seemingly separate biological vehicles, and forge a new kind of humanity whose higher purpose is to manifest the true meaning of prosperity.
        - The words that underpin the Gene Keys revelation are very carefully chosen. Every word resonates with a specific frequency. You will note that the title of the Pearl combines the two elements of **Prosperity** and **Liberation** – two words that are perhaps not often considered together. We will learn that the liberation of prosperity is about coming to a profound clarity of mind as well as gaining a vision of simplicity. We will also see how our capacity to thrive hinges on our ability to integrate both spiritual and material poles in our lives.
        - The other vital truth to be remembered here at the beginning of this third phase of your inner voyage concerns the relationship of your inner life to your outer life. In the introduction to the Golden Path, we learn that the potential outcome of this journey is to attain a state known as <mark>individuation</mark>.
        - _**Individuation refers to a process whereby the many different aspects of your life – your dreams, your relationships, your health, your finances, your spirituality – are brought together into an integrated harmony.**_ 
        - An individuated human being is a person whose inner life is in exact harmony with their outer life. In such a person, everything has become simplified. The power of your aloneness is the font of your strength, but it in no way isolates you from your community. On the contrary, your aloneness serves to strengthen your bonds within your community. In an individuated being, many emotional states are naturally processed and transmuted internally, causing far less friction, confusion, or energy loss in the environment. This also brings far more ease and simplicity into all your relationships. The more individuated you become, the more energy efficient you become.
        - These words from the introduction remind us of the whole purpose of the Golden Path voyage – to purify, intensify, and clarify your inner life in order that it ripples out, and becomes manifest in your outer life. In the Activation Sequence, we learn to become anchored in a deep sense of purpose as a knowing within the cells of our physical body. This, in time, will lead to a life of higher purpose lived in the world. Similarly, the Venus Sequence teaches us gently to coax our hearts open by fully entering into the nature of our suffering and thereby transforming it. This, in time, will lead to the manifestation of many truly fulfilling and open-hearted relationships.
        - The Pearl Sequence naturally follows the Venus Sequence, <mark>[[as the harvest that arises from the first two sequences^Ai2Q4zOGR0ky]]</mark>. Through the embodiment of our higher purpose and the opening of our heart, we engage the universe to assist us in our own higher destiny in the outer world. In the Pearl, we witness our true vocation choreographing the forces of synchronicity and bringing us into concert with a higher harmony involving many others operating at a similar frequency. In the Pearl, we also learn to further refine our outer expression through a continual contemplation of the essential in life.
      - **Contemplating the Essential**
        - What do we mean by contemplating the essential? This is the whole work of the Pearl. In our Pearl Sequence, we will contemplate four Spheres and their Gene Keys and Lines. Through the Shadows of these Gene Keys, you will see the various ways in which your life _leaks_ energy and vital power. The Pearl is like a mini-genetic circuit inside you – a _thrive capacitor_ that condenses, fuses, and focuses the entire potential of your higher purpose into a single integrating zero point within you – the central Sphere known as _the Pearl_.
        - As you will see, half the secret of prosperity is knowing what prosperity really means for you. We may have an image of our life that is at odds with the natural flow of our destiny, and it is this conditioned image that actually blocks the flow of true prosperity from manifesting. As you continue to open your heart more within your relationships, your priorities and principles may well begin to change. What once seemed important to you, may well fade into the horizon of your past, to be replaced by a vision rooted in simpler qualities that you perhaps used to overlook. Contemplating the essential therefore has a lot to do with the architecture of your inner life – your secret desires and expectations, as well as your unconscious beliefs and dreams.
        - As we enter into the realm of our Pearl Sequence, we shift planes once again – this time from the emotional/astral plane to the mental plane. The Pearl teaches us about the true nature and power of thought. We will come to see thinking as an extension of our deepest essence. It is a whirling emanation that can stir hidden forces into action, and instead of trapping us into a tight inner world of limiting beliefs, it can open us up to a wholehearted experience of consciousness at play.
        - Thinking as our deepest essence
      - **The Money Question**
        - Our modern world, whether we like it or not, revolves around money. We have become so used to this, that **very few of us question it or even contemplate what the world might be like without money**. As adults, money occupies a huge part of our thoughts and feelings. It is an intriguing truth, that it is very hard to find a person in the world who doesn’t wish he or she had more money! The Pearl opens up this subject of money for deep contemplation. Much has already been spoken on the subject of money, and much money has been made by people speaking on the subject! As the goal of the Venus Sequence is to open our hearts, the goal of the Pearl is to help us to fully prosper. And <mark>just as we open our hearts by forgiving ourselves and by taking a softer approach, so we learn to prosper by dropping our mental tightness around money.</mark> In both cases, we are learning to open inwardly rather than doing anything externally.
        - The Pearl gives us a new vision of the world. It even goes so far as to **envisage a world where money is no longer needed**. In this sense, it is a teaching ahead of its time, but it also provides us with a bridge to this extraordinary future. Sometimes we need to step fully beyond our current set of mental parameters, in order to see the present moment with clarity. A great deal of the wisdom of the Pearl involves seeing with clarity. Once we can see our own mind with absolute clarity, then the habits we have learned, and the anxiety we feel about money can dissipate. Remarkably, for most people, prosperity comes simply through deep mental clarity.
        - As we gain a new inner clarity through the Pearl, so we may well begin to make adjustments to our lives externally. This need not be through any conscious technique or strategy, but can emerge organically and in its own time. In the Golden Path, the Pearl is like the coda in a piece of music. It takes the momentum of the first two sequences and brings them to a structural conclusion. It also draws together all the elements of the whole Golden Path, and threads them into a complete tapestry.
        - Prosperity is therefore a result of purpose, and it follows and flows through an open-hearted approach to life. It also allows you the traveller to distill the contemplative wisdom that you have garnered along the way, and bring it to bear on your own life in a practical way. In this regard the Pearl is an exciting moment in your evolution, because it offers you the inner proof of the validity of your engagement, and is the reward of your commitment.
        - Going beyond ordinary mental parameters
          -  ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/tagr-prod.appspot.com/o/notespace%2Flipefraga%40gmail.com%2Fuploads%2F2025-02-04T20%3A18%3A53.318Z-image.png?alt=media&token=e43977fe-6962-409e-9308-f286907210eb) 
      - **The Purpose of Life is to Thrive**
        - In the Activation Sequence, we learn that our purpose in life is not only an external journey, but a deep-seated knowing in our DNA. To touch into your own higher purpose is to come fully into the present moment, into the wonderful vibrant pulse of life inside our body. When we feel and know our purpose as our essence, then we radiate health and vitality. Our body thrives and this thriving is life itself breathing through us. In the Venus Sequence, hologenetically folded up like a series of Russian dolls inside the Sphere of our Purpose, we learn what it means to thrive in relationship. Our hearts open in love and friendship, and we discover the higher purpose hidden in the chemistry of each relationship in our lives.
        - This gradual opening and softening also gives us a greater core stability, lending us a new strength from the inside out. In the Pearl, this opening extends further into our community through our work. Whatever our work is – whether it is a role in the business community, a creative impulse, or a role in service, that work is a potential outlet for our ability to thrive within the greater community of humanity. Purpose therefore has a threefold nature as it knits together our physical health, our ability to love and be loved, and our working life. When we are prospering, then all three of these aspects of our life are in harmony. The mystery of the Golden Path is that it shows you the natural sequence that brings this harmony about.
        - Our sense of purpose is vital for our physical body to thrive. Without a basic sense of self-esteem we cannot progress any further along the Golden Path. Love will remain locked to us. However, as soon as we activate this deep feeling of inner purpose, then we have a strong foundation for entering the profound voyage of Love. And as we begin to open our hearts to life once again through the teachings of our Venus Sequence, then we will begin to experience the spontaneous flowering of the Pearl as the forces of good fortune and prosperity flow into our life.
        - _**Purpose therefore has a threefold nature as it knits together our physical health, our ability to love and be loved, and our working life. When we are prospering, then all three of these aspects of our life are in harmony.**_
      - **Prosperity versus Wealth**
        - Before we enter into a contemplation of our Pearl Sequence, we need to have a clear understanding of the difference between prosperity and wealth. Wealth can be seen as the stockpiling of energy or money. It is generally regarded as a healthy thing to have as much money as possible in order to feel secure in life. This widely held belief drives much of our society. The Pearl however directly challenges the urge or need to create wealth. Wealth is heavy. Rather than creating freedom and a sense of purpose, it tends to create a deep energetic drag in our lives. The more we have, the more we feel a need to spend it, and the more we spend it, the more complicated our lives become. We accumulate more _stuff_ and more responsibilities. We humans so often complicate our lives without even realising it.
        - This natural tendency to want to spend the money we have (and indeed the money we don’t have!) is worthy of further consideration. Why do we feel the need to do this? Perhaps the reason lies deeper than we realise. When we look at nature, we see a similar pattern. Once the fruit has flowered, the tree drops it to the ground. Nature doesn’t hoard. Nature is constantly flowering and releasing in tune with the seasons. This is the great secret of prosperity – the secret of flow. Whereas wealth stagnates, prosperity is a flow. We receive and then we give, creating a vacuum into which life once again flows.
        - This is the great secret of prosperity – the secret of flow. Whereas wealth stagnates, prosperity is a flow.
          -  ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/tagr-prod.appspot.com/o/notespace%2Flipefraga%40gmail.com%2Fuploads%2F2025-02-04T20%3A08%3A40.818Z-image.png?alt=media&token=f76f2714-9717-451d-ba6e-e3d189eee29b) 
        - Prosperity is also about more than spending the energy we have accumulated – it is about spending it in the right way. It is about spending it on the essential – on that which enhances, inspires, simplifies, and lightens, rather than on the inessential, which drains, burdens, and complicates your life.
        - As you enter into the transmission of the Pearl, you are invited to begin an inventory of your own life. You may wish to look around your home and consider the things which are essential, as opposed to those which are inessential. William Morris, the father of the Arts and Crafts Movement in the nineteenth century famously said: ‘Have nothing in your house that you do not know to be useful, or believe to be beautiful’.
        - You can also extend this inventory of the essential to other areas – the most important of all being your time. How do you spend your time? What does the _essential_ mean for you? For most people, essential time refers to two things: time to fulfill our basic responsibilities and time for personal enrichment. What does personal enrichment mean to you and what importance do you place on it? To experience the flow of prosperity in your life, you will need to know the answers to these questions.
        - Prosperity is a state of mind. It is an attitude, a knack, and a delight we must learn to cultivate. The Pearl will repeatedly ask you to look at the ways in which you accumulate weight: this can be physical, emotional, and intellectual. There is no judgement in any of this – we are simply having the courage to look honestly at ourselves once again.
      - **Contemplation**
        - That was a lot to take in…take a pause to contemplate these questions:
        - To what extent does your inner life match your outer life? Draw a line down a page and explore the differences and similarities.
        - How would you describe your current relationship to money? Try and find a symbol or metaphor for this.
      - **To Prosper is to Serve**
        - The above statement, simple though it sounds, unlocks another of life’s great secrets – that through giving our time in service to a higher purpose, we can find a short-cut to prosperity.
        - This is the mystical version of a _get rich quick_ programme! When our heart opens fully (as described in the Venus Sequence), it naturally floods us with the urge to share our love as widely as possible. Unconditional love is a kind of healthy pressure inside us, like a lustrous raincloud looking for a dry pasture to fall upon. Most of the world’s great mystical traditions and religions have this urge to do good at their heart. The trick is to _do good_ for the right reason, and in the right way, at the right time. Your Pearl Sequence will help you to see how and where you are best _designed_ to serve your higher purpose.
        - The urge to be of service, although highly noble, can also be a great inner trap. It is one of the many ways in which the Shadow frequency can distract us away from our own deeper issues. Sometimes we give, in order _not_ to have to receive. For many of us, receiving love is the thing we secretly yearn for the most, and it is also the thing we fear the most. To prosper, our lives must be an equal balance of giving and receiving. We must serve ourselves, our relationships and the world in equal measure. You can look again at your own life, and see whether any of these areas are _overweight_ or _underweight_. The Pearl will help you to redress this balance. We may be wealthy on the material plane, but unlucky in love, or we may have a loving relationship, but struggle with money. Prosperity cannot be compartmentalised, but is a _total_ phenomenon, embracing all aspects of our lives simultaneously. It is unifying, simple, and surprisingly easy to bring into your life.

      - **The Money Triangle: the structure of the Pearl**
        - Your Pearl Sequence operates in a different way from the other two Sequences that comprise the Golden Path. Although it still unlocks in a sequence, it creates an energetic vortex in your life. At the centre of this vortex is the Pearl itself – the crystalisation of your prosperity. Your Pearl blooms as a reward unlocked by the currents of grace. It is the result of a quantum effect that is triggered through the manifestation of your higher purpose on the material plane.

        - The mystery of the Golden Path occurs as we embody its truths. Your Hologenetic Profile offers a limited two-dimensional view of these truths. It is simply a pathworking tool that we can use to remind us of the various universal principles that bring about prosperity on all levels. The Pearl Sequence is structured as a triangle with a central hub. Each point of this triangle is imprinted through one of three planetary archetypes. These are Mars, Jupiter, and the Sun – three of the great masculine archetypes in the heavens. Just as the Venus Sequence is a feminine transmission, so the Pearl is more masculine.
        - The world of money has always seemed to require a more masculine approach – at least that is, until now. Following the Venus Sequence, the Pearl describes a completely new approach to money that is so radical, it will likely take many centuries to be fully realised.
        - The basis of the Pearl is the universal principle of philanthropy. We sometimes also refer to this using a new word: syntropy. Syntropy is the intelligent and healthy redistribution of energy within a system that brings a higher harmony to that system, allowing it to fully thrive and transcend its own limitations. This redistribution is not only material, but also mental and emotional.
        - In the Venus Sequence, we learn that intelligence requires that our ideas and impulses come into alignment with higher principles, so it is often our thoughts and beliefs that have to change first of all. This is the other reason why the Pearl has a more masculine orientation – because it is about the mind as opposed to the emotions. Your Pearl Sequence reorients your thinking around money, and the whole concept of _making money_. We do not make money. We watch money come in, and we watch it go out. The trick then is not about _making_ money. As we shall see, the trick is all in the watching.

      - **The Eye of Horus: the eye of the needle**
        - For millenia mankind has used symbols to encode the truths we have discovered. The power of a symbol is that it lends itself to being understood across many dimensions. We can understand it mentally, we can see it visually, and we can sense its meaning intuitively. One of the symbols used by many cultures is that of the all-seeing eye. In Egyptology this is known as the _Eye of Horus_. The eye of Horus also appears as the eye of providence, and famously appears on the back of the US one dollar bill. The eye is a symbol of the unbroken awareness of the siddhic state of consciousness. It might therefore seem unusual to see it connected to money and to providence or fortune.

        - The all-seeing eye represents the eternal present moment, and our ability to rest in this moment is the secret to unlocking true prosperity. To live in the present moment is to live with lightness, without baggage or worries. Prosperity demands that we drop our mental projections of the world and our dreams of how our life might be better one day.
        - Prosperity has nothing to do with money or with the future – it is the living current of vital presence that is ever-emerging from our core. Money is one of the great sticking places for our addictive thinking. We think we need more money, but that train of thinking constantly pulls us out of the present moment where prosperity lives.
        - The Pearl teachings, like all the Gene Keys teachings, are founded upon universal truths. When Christ spoke the words: _It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God_ – he spoke a great truth. No matter if this is even an incorrect translation of the original text, as some claim. It remains a truth. He was talking about the difference between wealth and prosperity. To prosper is to be light in consciousness, rather than being weighed down by our perception. The mistake we make is to try and find happiness. We tend to believe that happiness has to do with having more money, so we trap ourselves in a net of our own expectations and hopes.
        - The very word _prosper_ is rooted in the Latin meaning to hope for. We hope for happiness in the future, instead of accepting that which is in the present. In the present, we find something far greater than happiness – we find fulfilment. To be fulfilled means to be at ease deep inside your own being. Happiness comes and happiness goes. Sadness comes and sadness goes. But fulfilment is the field that lives behind both poles, and fulfilment is analogous to true prosperity.
