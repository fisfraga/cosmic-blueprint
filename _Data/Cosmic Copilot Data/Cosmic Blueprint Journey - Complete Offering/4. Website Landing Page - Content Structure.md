## FAQ SECTION

### Section Title
**Questions & Answers**

**Q: Do I need to know my exact birth time?**
A: For Human Design and detailed astrology, yes. For Gene Keys and numerology, date is sufficient. We can work with what you have and focus on traditions that don't require exact timing.

**Q: What if I'm completely new to Tana?**
A: Perfect! You'll learn everything needed to use your Self-Knowledge Hub effectively. No prior Tana experience required.

**Q: Can I choose different wisdom systems than the default ones?**
A: Yes. The four core systems (Astrology, HD, Gene Keys, Numerology) are recommended for integration, but we can customize based on your interests and needs.

**Q: How long does it take to complete the journey?**
A: Individual coaching typically spans 6-8 weeks. Cohort is 6 weeks. But your digital system serves you for life - this is just the foundation building.

**Q: Can I add more wisdom traditions later?**
A: Absolutely! Additional systems are $99 each and integrate seamlessly into your existing hub.

**Q: Is this religious or tied to any specific belief system?**
A: No. These are consciousness tools and wisdom frameworks that work regardless of religious beliefs. They complement rather than replace any spiritual or religious practice.

**Q: How are the AI agents personalized to me?**
A: Each agent is configured with your specific birth data, chart placements, and profile information. They provide insights based on YOUR unique cosmic blueprint, not generic interpretations.

**Q: What if I'm skeptical about some of these systems?**
A: Healthy skepticism is welcome. The power is in the integration - when multiple systems point to the same truth, even skeptics find validation. Start with traditions you're drawn to and expand from there.
