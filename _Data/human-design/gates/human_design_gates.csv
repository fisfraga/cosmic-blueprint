### The Positive and Negative Sides of Human Design Gate 1

All energy in theHuman Design chart exists on a spectrum of potential.

On one end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 1 is the energy for Creativity. It leads by example and knows that it’s greatest impact on the world happens when you stay true to your creative process.

On the other end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 1 is the energy for believing that you should be able to be creative all the time or that being depressed or low means that something is wrong with you. It Resists your creative ebbs and flows.

You’ll learn about the surprising (but most effective) way to raise your energy frequency in theHuman Design Map + Portal.

In the meantime, start noticing when you are feeling anxious, needy or moody but don’t be an asshole to yourself. Treat yourself the way you would a small child – with love, curiosity, and understanding.

### My Personal Experience with Human Design Gate 1 (Gene Key 1)

Gate 1 is the G Center side of the 1-8 Channel of Inspiration.

(I do a deep dive on all channels inside the Human Design Map portal.Get yours here.)

And while gate 1 is undefined in my chart, I do haveHuman Design Gate 8defined in my unconscious Jupiter. And, since both the 1 and the 8 areprojected gates,  some have said that gate 8 is like the PR team for gate 1.

The other interesting thing to note is that according to theGene Keys, the unconscious Jupiter is the “culture” sphere inthe pearl sequence. The pearl sequence is how prosperity is activated in our charts. And the “culture” sphere is like the thing that the people in your orbit value the most.

Which means that in my business, the thing that my people value the most is making a contribution by being their authentic selves (gate 8).

((You’ll learn even more about what your Human Design tells you about marketing and business inside theHuman Design Mapportal.)

So, with the full picture of Gate 8 being like the PR team and Gate 1 being the creativity, I tend to draw in highly creative people who really want to make a contribution in the world. They want to make marks that make a difference.

And one of the things I’ve noticed is that people with Gate 1 defined in their chart have a tendency to hold the story that if they aren’t at the top Creative game, that something is wrong with them.

They often expect to be on a creative high 24/7 and start to question themselves and their purpose (human design gate 28) when they are feeling low. Those low feelings roll in, and, all of a sudden, t

hey start telling themselves that the Universe is punishing them for being human. They tell themselves that if they were better at managing their emotions or could just stay “high vibe,” they would be Creative all the time.

I’ve been there myself more times than I could even count.

What I’ve come to understand, in both helping people who have gate 1 defined and in my own experience of creativity, is that it is so important to trust the natural ebbs and flows of creaticity. And that it doesn’t actually mean anything has gone wrong when you aren’t banging away at a creative project.

And the story that you are somehow unworthy because of the “negitive vibes” actually hinders the process of creativity. The low feelings are a critical part of the creative process.

As we stay present with the lows and allow ourselves to alchemize them in a natural way, rather than trying to push them away, they become creative fuel. They become a part of the story of our art and craft.

(I’ll show you the ropes of how true alchemy works inside theHuman Design Mapportal. If you are already one of mymapclients, go to your portal dashboard and start at the beginning of the Deconditioning Toolbox.)

The only thing the “low vibes” prove is your humanity. You cannot make beautiful art (literal or metaphorical) without them. It is the full spectrum of what it means to be human that is most beautiful.

Up and down it goes like a great wave across my own homeAll the questions of the mind trying to find a way to showThat I got darkness I got light I got everything in betweenDon’t deny any sideI don’t cut branches off my treeGreat storm clouds holding rainIt’s part of nature to hold a bit of painAll in all, that rain falls, and then we watch a new thing growTrevor Hall, In and Through the Body, ​Great Storm Clouds

Human Design Gate 1 shows us that “the low” is just as important as “the high” in your most authentic self-expression. Its energy. In motion.

I’ll show you how to embody that inside theHuman Design Mapportal.

In the meantime, be present with yourself. Let the “low vibes” be a part of your process and you will make even more profound art.

It can only be that way.

When you stand in the Truth that your lows don’t mean anything about your Creative potential…

What does Creativity mean to you?

Are you connected to your Creativity?

### My Personal Experience with Human Design Gate 2 (Gene Key 2)

When I was in the second grade, I wrote a story that was published in the local newspaper. And my teacher was way more excited about it than I was. She kept telling me how proud she was that I’d had something published at such a young age.

Now, of course, we weren’t talking about the New York Times, here. But to the adults around me, it seemed like a big deal and I was completely confused.

Truth be told, I was very uncomfortable with the praise.

The thing is, writing has always come naturally to me. I’d even go so far as to say that it’s easy.

Myhead,ajna,throat,spleen, andGare all defined. My throat alone has six defined gates (62, 16, 20, 31, 8, and 56), three of which are full channels (16-48, 57-20, and 31-7).

Gate 62is in theunconscious sunof myincarnation cross—known for communicating complex ideas with clarity and precision.

And I have a Gemini Moon conjunct Jupiter in the second house.

So you might say it was written in the stars for me to be a wordsmith.

But at the time, my ability to write felt… ordinary.

My brain and nervous system didn’t have the capacity to believe that something so easy for me could be worthy of praise. I didn’t have the ability to let it in.

Learning that Gate 2 is undefined in my chart helped that experience click into place.

In Human Design,the undefined places in our chartare where we’re here to grow, to observe with compassion, and eventually to gain deep wisdom. But that wisdom doesn’t arrive overnight. It unfolds through lived experience—and that is exactly what is happening with my capacity to receive.

Looking back, I can see that moment for what it was: a key moment in learning to receive.

In time, I’ve come to recognize that writing is one of my gifts. I have a unique way of thinking, ordering, and playing with words that others appreciate. And it’s teaching me how to receive on so many levels.

Writing isn’t just a thing I do or the way I deliver value with the​Human Design Map & Portal​. It is a spiritual practice. Where I understand myself, the world around me, and that thing that some call God.

There is a mercurial kind of magick that happens when I put my fingers on the keyboard (or pen to paper!) that often leaves me in awe.

And that is exactly what happened in the early days of creating my signature energy healing method (now taught inside the​Human Design Map & Portal​as the MAP Method for Deconditioning).

Back then, it was called something different. But the essence hasn’t changed at all.

Its structure and flow are based on alchemical magick. It walks you through the seven healing phases that underpin all transformation. It works no matter what you’re trying to change because it gets to the heart of why we ignore our inner wisdom and reveals how to leverage our natural energy in fully aligned ways.

Each phase of the process has an energetic objective that lets you know exactly where you are in the healing arc—and signals when you’re ready to move into the next phase.(I walk you through this entire process step-by-step inside the MAP Method, which is included in the​Human Design Map & Portal​.)

The last phase of the alchemical process is what I call “The Promised Land.” And when writing it, I had a realization so simple and clarifying that I could hardly believe what my fingers were typing:

Receiving is feeling. It is allowing your body to fully experience the sensations of fulfillment.

Maybe you call those sensations success, satisfaction, peace, delightful surprise… or even abundance, affirmation, or alignment.

Whatever you call it, though, they are alive in your body and the process is the same:

You locate the sensation in your body. You stay with the feeling. You let it vibrate through you.

No analyzing. No pretending to be humble. No pushing it away with confusion. No minimizing what you’ve created. No writing it off as a fluke.

But instead—opening to it. Softening into it. Letting it enter your being.

Letting yourselfbecomethe vibration in real-time.

Letting yourself know, in your bones, what it feels like for your heart to expand.

What it feels like for your aura to hum at that frequency.

What it feels like when joy, reverence, gratitude, abundance, bliss, and pleasurewash through your entire being.

To receive is to surrender to the full spectrum of “positive” emotions that are available to you as a human being.

What a revelation.

Since that moment, I’ve coached hundreds—if not thousands—of people through the practice of receiving. Watching the light bulb go off is always miraculous.

And on a personal level, it has healed so much.

When I bring something to fruition in my life, I now understand that my work—completing the cycle of alchemy—is to be present in my body. To let the feelings of success move through me.

Every time I remember and practice that, my capacity for more success expands. It clears out the “blocks” that prevent me from receiving more love, abundance, and magick.

And writing?

It’s still one of the most natural things in the world for me.

But now, when someone tells me that my words moved them…

When a client says my work changed their life…

When I’m acknowledged for the clarity, precision, or depth I bring…

I can feel it. I canlet it in.

I notice when I want to deflect, downplay, or disappear in the moment. And make the conscious choice to breathe it in. To let it move me. To receive it.

It’s as simple and as profound as that.

And what once felt confusing now feels like truth.

The energy of Gate 2 has shown me that receiving isn’t passive—it’s presence. If you’re ready to open to your own capacity for alignment, abundance, and purpose, the​Human Design Map & Portal​will show you the way.

## My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 3 (Gene Key 3)

Gate 3.4 is defined in my conscious and unconscious Chiron (often called the wounded healer) and directly conjunct my Rising. Meaning my identity (rising) is inseparable from (conjunct) helping others heal what I cannot heal in myself (chiron).

Neither our Rising nor Chiron create definition in the bodygraph. However, when it comes to Chiron, Ra Uru Hu was adamant about its significance as we age. In fact, for 6th lineprofiles, the Chiron Return marks coming “off the roof” and stepping into the role model identity.

(Want a deep dive on your profile? You’ll love the detail and support in theHuman Design Map & Portal.)

Becoming wise over the course of one’s life isn’t limited to sixth lines, though; it is the heart of the human story. And Chiron was an example of that.

In Greek mythology, Chiron was a wise and immortal centaur—teacher, guide, and healer to the gods. Hercules accidentally shot Chiron with a deadly poisoned arrow. But because Chiron was immortal, the arrow created an un-healable wound and he was forced to suffer for eternity.

Meanwhile, something else was happening in the mythic realm.

Another god—Prometheus—had defied Zeus by stealing fire from the heavens and giving it to humanity. That fire wasn’t just warmth or light; it was the divine spark of consciousness, creativity, and transformation.

For this rebellion, Zeus chained Prometheus to a rock, where an eagle came each day to eat his liver. Every night, the liver regenerated, and the suffering continued—an eternal punishment for giving humans the power of fire.

Seeing the deep need for humans to be bestowed with creative fire, Chiron gave up his immortality to free Prometheus.

We could rabbit-hole on the golden threads of symbolism there all day. But what really moves me is how it lives inside my own chart—and how it’s shaped my actual life.

In the IChing, Gate 3 is called “Difficulty at the Beginning.” It comes with the kind of chaos that can make you question every choice you ever made—your plan, your path, your purpose, and yourself.

And while facing chaos in my own beginnings has always been a struggle, helping others transmute chaos into power and magic? That’s always come easily.

When I first started my business in 2009—long before I found Human Design—I was working as a health coach. I helped women with food and body image healing and I immediately noticed a powerful pattern:

People would decide to change, and like clockwork, everything would fall apart. Not just slip-ups or doubts—real chaos. Things got worse instead of better. They blamed themselves. Called themselves weak. Spun in shame.

Today, I see the same thing inside theHuman Design Map Portal.

As humans, we tend to believe that chaos means that we are doing something wrong.

But, when I am helping someone navigate the brave work of making new, purposeful, and aligned choices, it is always crystal clear to me that nothing is going wrong.

Their intentions are working. They are walking the path. They are more powerful than they ever realized.

Chaos is the sign of that deep truth. It is an invitation to look with fresh eyes.

Because the thing is this—the first stage of alchemy is FIRE.

You throw the symbolic lead into the symbolic flames, and it burns away anything that isn’t aligned with your gold.

So when the shit hits the fan at the beginning? That’s not failure. That’s alchemy coming in hot. Literally.

The problem is that if we’re spinning in shame, we miss the message. We think the chaos means we’re broken or off track, when it’s actually evidence that magick is afoot.

This has been a core part of my message for well over a decade now. Chaos is expected and necessary.

And when that clicks for someone, like really in their bones clicks, it is like watching a light bulb turn on.

Shame transforms into curiosity. Resistance softens into presence. Shadows become light.

As if it were Divinely written, it’s exactly what I teach inside theHuman Design Map & Portal. And with each person I guide, it’s a moment of remembering for me, too. When their shame transforms, so does mine. It brings me back to my own humanity and the knowing that I am not alone.

Knowing that my Rising and Chiron sit together in 3.4 helps, too. I can see the threads and the invitation—to allow my creative fire to lead, and to sacrifice my shame in order to do it.

Truth be told, I still sometimes catch myself being hard on myself when things don’t flow right out of the gate. I have to remind myself that chaos is not a failure—chaos is themap. And, paradoxically, it’s a natural part of order.

None of us get to skip the reality of being human. The 3-60 format channel teaches us that the mystery of chaos (3) and magick (60) is just part of what it means to be alive.

And what I know for sure is this:

Making art…transformation…giving birth to a new identity… is messy.

Difficulty at the beginning is not a problem. It’s part of the story—and embracing it is how magick is made.

When we approach that chaos with our eyes and hearts wide open, surrendering our shame to the fire, it all turns to gold in the end.

It can only be that way.

If you’re standing in the middle of your own new beginning and everything feels chaotic, please know that you’re not doing it wrong.

You’re in the fire. And it is indeed making gold.

### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 4 (Gene Key 4)

The way life works is such a beautiful mystery to me (says myHuman Design Gate 61).

When I originally wrote this contemplation (2022), I had been writing theHuman Design Gates Libraryfor many months. I’d written it in the order of the suntransitsand only had a small number of gates left to go.

There were many layers of work that went into getting the library published. My part was to write these personal contemplations and my due date was a couple months before the transit itself. This allowed plenty of time and space for my team to do their part.

And one thing I found quite magical was how the timing of writing the contemplation seemed to be perfectly aligned with something happening in my life at that time. It didn’t matter that the transit itself was 2 months away.

Which, side note, because the Human Design gates are symbols of human archetypes, they arealwaysrelevant. You could pick any gate at random and find the benefit of contemplating it right then and there. The transits simply shine specific light onto them and give us the opportunity to see them through that specific lens.

Anyway, back to the 4.

For whatever reason, when the due date for the 4 originally came up, I put it off for over a week. I had no energy for it.

I’d been in a deep hole of unprocessed anger and the idea of writing about forgiveness felt like a cosmic joke.

As you may already know, I’m a 5/2 profile and my aura is surrounded by the “double projection field.” Which essentially means that my karmic role is to clean up karma by being on the receiving end of two different types of projection.

(You’ll learn more about your profile and karmic role in theHuman Design Map.)

Learning about my 5/2 profile was the thing that got me hooked on Human Design. Coming to understand the double projection field shifted my entire perspective. In an instant, I saw myself, my life, and my relationships with crystalline clarity.

Lifetimes of shame and anger melted and my heart cracked wide open.

Richard Rudd, the creator ofthe Gene Keys, says the fifth line’s main inner work is forgiveness. It took me some time to really understand why he said that. It is because of the mechanics of the projection field.

The 5th line is on the receiving end of projection to be the hero, the savior, the one who can fix all that ails someone. Other people, often at their rock bottom, are looking for a savior and hang their hope onto the 5th line. And the 5th line will be none the wiser – it will all be projection.

And anyone in a projection field (the 5 or the 2), cannot stop the projection from happening. Just as the one who is doing the projection can’t stop it.

It is mechanical, not personal. It’s all part of the karmic web we weave in this game called life.

The only thing those in a projection field can do is to be clear about what is theirs to own/do and let the rest go. And when they do that, it creates a cascade of events that have the potential to rapidly transmute disempowered patterns of karma.

And, whether we are conscious of it or not, letting go of what we think others should have done is what forgiveness is.

But it isn’t a process we can force. It is a process of leaning into what is real and alive in any given moment. And loving ourselves through it. Even when it hurts like hell.

This is particularly important with the 5th line because, sometimes, being projected upon in “incorrect” ways cuts down to the soul. The fantasy breaks that you are being seen for who you really are and you discover that the other person only had what you could do for them in mind.

And that is exactly where I was, back in 2022, when the original version of this contemplation came due.

I’d been on the receiving end of an incredibly painful and wildly incorrect projection. I was devastated, confused, and questioning the foundations of a long lasting relationship.

But, something about this felt different.

In the past, especially before I understood my human design profile,  I would take these projections on by making them about me.

As a result, I became the world’s biggest people pleaser. I would just accept anything ever said about me and call it fact. I let people blame me for crazy shit that had nothing to do with me and everything to do with their inability to process their own shame. I took on other people’s shame, despair, and hopelessness and made it my own. I bent myself into a million different pretzels trying to make sure that no one ever felt disappointed on my watch.

Over the years with HD, though, I have learned to really deeply question “the roots” of what other people think, feel, and do in response to my energy.

Just like I recommend my 5th linemapclients, I operate on the assumption thateverythingis a projection. And I’ve put it in the realm of mechanical and karmic, rather than personal.

And this really magical thing happens where, from that perspective, I can see what actually is mine and what is theirs. When something is mine, I take full responsibility for it and I let the rest go.

It has taken conscious effort and a metric fuck ton ofdeconditioning. And it doesn’t always happen in an instant.

But this particular instant, just as Gate 4 was coming due, I crossed an important turning point.

It stung like a mother fucker. But I could also see the ridiculous nature of the projection. There was no hemming and hawing. No wondering what I’d done to deserve it. And no taking on bullshit.

My feelings of anger came in strong and hot, showing me where my boundaries are and how to reconcile them.

I don’t take on the burden of other people’s projections. I let them bounce off of me and will no longer spend hours, days, weeks, months, years ruminating on them.

In those moments, everything I had been practicing came to life in a whole new way. I just let the anger be there. I felt it, in my body, and allowed it to bring focus to what belongs to me and what doesn’t.

I leaned into what was real and alive.

Suddenly, there was no part of me that believed the other person should have behaved differently.

And I began to feel grateful for the incorrect projection. I reveled in the opportunity to gain deeper clarity about myself, my boundaries, and what I will and will not do.

I felt compassionate gratitude that this person had zero capacity to take responsibility for themselves and their decisions. I felt grateful that they poured their disappointment onto me like hot honey.

I returned it to sender and acted with a level of integrity that I am proud of.

By processing my anger and embodying its wisdom, I naturally moved into forgiveness.

I literally cannot control what other people see in me and trying to doesn’t just hurt me, it hurts them, too. It steals their opportunity to own and heal their shit, and my karma isn’t having any of that.

### The Positive and Negative Sides of Human Design Gate 5

All energy in theHuman Design chart exists on a spectrum of potential.

On the “positive” end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 5 is the energy forconsistency. Gate 5 trusts in the rhythm of life and, in that trust, is empowered to create habits, routines, and rituals that truly work.

On the “negative” end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 5 is the energy for becoming so obsessed with establishing perfect habits and routines that you never take any action. This is especially likely when you feel overwhelmed by too many opportunities and choices for how to invest your time.

You’ll learn about the surprising (but most effective) way to raise your energy frequency in theHuman Design Map + Portal.

In the meantime, start noticing when you are feeling stuck, inconsistent or not flexible enough but don’t be an asshole to yourself. Treat yourself the way you would a small child – with love, curiosity, and understanding.

### My Personal Experience with Human Design Gate 5 (Gene Key 5)

Gate 5 isdefinedin my conscious and unconscious Neptune.

I call the Neptune placement your “maya.”

In the East, maya is a term that describes the illusion of being separate from the Divine. Maya is like a web that we tangle in and struggle to get out.

The maya is an essential part of the Divine game of Hide and Seek.

“God likes to play hide-and-seek, but because there is nothing outside of God, he has no one but himself to play with! But he gets over this difficulty by pretending that he is not himself. This is his way of hiding from himself. He pretends that he is you and I and all the people in the world, all the animals, plants, all the rocks, and all the stars. In this way he has strange and wonderful adventures, some of which are terrible and frightening. But these are just like bad dreams, for when he wakes up they will disappear.”Alan Watts,The Book: On The Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are

If you’ve been in my world for more than a minute or have yourHuman Design Map, you have undoubtedly seen my references to “forgetting and remembering.”

“We forget and remember. And we forget again.”Trevor Hall, Kala, Bowl of Light

As I mention in themap, in this game of Divine Hide and Seek, we aren’t supposed to stop forgetting. The real journey is in remembering. And remembering to remember.

Being human means to forget.

Neptune is the place where we forget who we really are. Neptune makes this illusory game fun.

For me, with gate 5 in both of my Neptune placements, habits, routines, and rituals have been a key in playing the game.

I’ve fought hard to overcome a number of destructive habits.

I’ve stopped binge eating and drinking, drugs, sex with strangers, and people-pleasing.

BTW, if you want to learn my process, step-by-step, for using spiritual alchemy to overcome habits that prevent you from remembering, I teach it in the Deconditioning Toolbox, which is included when you purchase yourHuman Design Map.

All of those habits were how I hid from myself. As I mentioned in my post aboutHuman Design Gate 24, they were all ways to escape the intense mystery of silence (24).

And when we hide from ourselves, we step further and further away from who we really are.In keeping with gate 5 in both Neptunes, for me, it has really been a process of coming back to myself, again and again.

Eating, drinking, drugs, and sex have all been places where I transform illusion into clarity of my Divine I AM.At this point, I’ve given up the idea that I will never engage in “bad” habits or struggle with creating supportive rituals and routines. I’m trying to never say never, tbh.

Because even after quitting drugs, drinking, binging, and sex with strangers, I’ve come to understand that habits, routines, and rituals will likely always be a gateway into transforming the maya.

I’m not supposed to stop forgetting. I’m supposed to keep remembering.

So, I will keep using the energy of Gate 5 to help me discover more about myself, what I need to feel supported, and what helps me remember.

If you want support as you remember to remember, get yourmapand go on the journey inside themapportal.

### The Positive and Negative Sides of Human Design Gate 6

All energy in theHuman Design chart exists on a spectrum of potential.

On the “positive” end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 6 is the energy for using conflict as a doorway into inner peace. Gate 6 understands that individual emotional stability and clarity create stability and clarity in relationships. With this knowing, it takes full responsibility for its emotions before “confronting” others and doesn’t engage in needless confrontation.

On the “negative” end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 6 is the energy for emotional volatility or reactivity that creates chaos in the outer world. Gate 6 can tend towards fighting for things that don’t matter or projecting unresolved emotions onto others. This all contributes to unnecessary conflict in relationships.

You’ll learn about the surprising (but most effective) way to raise your energy frequency in theHuman Design Map + Portal.

In the meantime, start noticing when you are feeling defensive, chaotic or like you are hiding your true self but don’t be an asshole to yourself. Treat yourself the way you would a small child – with love, curiosity, and understanding.

### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 6 (Gene Key 6)

A while back, in my post aboutHuman Design Gate 4and forgiveness, I wrote about how contemplating the gates for these posts always arrives in such Divine timing. It is like it doesn’t matter that I’m updating the post a couple months before the upcoming sun transit. They land in divine timing, no matter when I’m doing the writing.

Gate 6 is one of the gates that my “due date” (to get the contemplation into my team for scheduling) comes at the perfect time.

One of my habits for these posts has been to review the material I have already written about the gate for theHuman Design Map.

One of the things that stands out for the “high frequency”  expression of Gate 6 is this:

Using your emotional clarity to know which conflicts are worth resolving and which ones aren’t.

It seems so resonant because I havegate 59, line 5, defined and hanging in my unconscious mars. I go into a bit more detail about mars in thegate 59post  but, in essence, our unconscious mars is one of our core relational wounds. And it eventually becomes our “vocation.”

(I talk about that more in depth about vocation in the “Human Design and Business Messaging” guide inside theHuman Design Mapportal. If you are a client, you can read that guidehere.)

Gate 59 is all about vulnerability and breaking down walls to intimacy; it is the harmonic gate to gate 6 and together, they create the channel of mating.

For a long time, as I mentioned in the gate 59 post, my primary mode of operation has been to be more and more vulnerable in the hopes of breaking down walls. And I’ve done so to my detriment.

I’ve had countless relationships where vulnerability was not a two-way street, and, in some cases, my vulnerability was even used as a weapon against me.

I started to realize that, as Brene Brown says, all people hadn’t “earned the right” to my vulnerability. And I’ve made it a conscious practice to be more discerning about who, where, and why I am vulnerable with others.

What never dawned on me, though, until the original contemplation of gate, was the people who “earn the right” to my vulnerability are the people who have the capacity to take responsibility for their emotions.

They don’t make it a regular habit of blaming others for their inner state of being. They are able to work through relationships chaos caused by their unconscious projections. And, they don’t try to “force me” to hold space for them while they process their projections of me.

In other words, they are more actively embodied in the “high frequency” of gate 6 (or are at least attempting to be!).

When I look at the relationships where I thrive, this is true every single time, and any time it isn’t, the relationship goes south. I don’t stay in relationships with people who aren’t capable of emotional maturity on that level.

And it has taken me a long time to accept that about myself. My undefined solar plexus is no longer willing to be the sponge and savior of other people’s emotional baggage.

A while back, I ended a relationship with someone because of this very thing.

My spleen said NO to further contact and I finally listened. After decades, I walked away. I was no longer going to be the villain in their emotional drama.

Truth be told though, it was a hard decision, mentally, I was also holding onto the story that only horrible people end such prominent relationships. I’ve thought maybe I should be even more vulnerable and open. And I’ve questioned if I’m really the crazy one here or if I have a right to such strong boundaries.

But, now, a year has passed since the original writing of this post and it is even clearer that my spleen really did know. It was not good for my well-being to stay in that relationship. I don’t have the energy to maintain relationships with people who are in the “low frequency” of gate 6 and I am no longer willing to try and cultivate that energy.

It doesn’t mean they are “bad” people. They are just humans, too.

But, I don’t need to hang on, either. I’ve let the guilt trip go.

As is so often said in traditional Human Design, it isn’t personal – it’s mechanical.

Some conflicts are worth resolving. And others aren’t.

Good to know.

All energy in theHuman Design chart exists on a spectrum of potential.

On the “positive” end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 7 is the energy for offering empowering wisdom, guidance, and advice to others.  Gate 7 has an innate understanding that forceful leadership is the mask one wears when one does not understand their true power. They “lead from behind” by showing others that accessing their own inner power is how magic and transformation occur.

On the “negative” end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 7 is the energy for being on a power trip and insisting others bend to your will. It may try to rally people around its personal beliefs rather than what is best for the collective or boss others around without their consent.

### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 7 (Gene Key 7)

A couple of years into my coaching career, I worked with a coach that was helping me create the vision of what I wanted my business to be.

This was over a decade ago – long before I knew anything about Human Design or even what my true talents were.

But I vividly remember a conversation we had because it was like a tiny light in a dark sea of confusion.

She asked me to name a celebrity that I wanted to be like and started listing out names.

She said many of her clients wanted to be like Oprah.

And, before I knew what was happening, I said:

I don’t want to be like Oprah. I want to be like Oprah’s mentor.

Because I didn’t know anything about Human Design, I didn’t know that I have the full 31/7 channel in my design. And I certainly hadn’t fully owned my natural abilities to guide and lead.

But I did know that I didn’t want to be the star of the show.

I wanted to be behind the scenes empowering others with the truth of their being – helping them to own their gifts, talents, and sovereign power – and making their unique contribution to the world (Human Design Gate 8).

Since that sacred conversation with that coach, I’ve gone on to coach, guide, and mentor people who are doing amazing things in the world.

And nothing has delighted me more than watching someone go out into the world – taking a tiny nugget I offered them – and make pure magic with it.

Today, it looks completely different than it used to because I don’t do one-to-one coaching anymore. I only offer theHuman Design Map.

But I still get to witness the power of showing others how to access their innate power. Whether it is seeing a post on social media, a quick DM, or an email exchange, it is one of my greatest honors, and it will never, ever get old.

### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 8 (Gene Key 8)

Gate 8 is defined in my Unconscious Jupiter.  And, true to the nature of the unconscious side of the chart, Gate 8 has been a really powerful gateway into shadow for me.

On the conscious side, Jupiter is our path to expanding into abundance, prosperity, miracles, and healing. And on the unconscious side, it reveals the primary shadows and “blocks” that stop the flow.

(Jupiter’s placements are also important in the big picture of prosperity and can be very important for business owners to understand. I have a guide insidethe map portalthat tells you what Jupiter means through that lens.)

My conscious Jupiter is inHuman Design Gate 20, which is all about being present in the now, contemplation, and expressing truth when it arises.

In other words, I create abundance, healing, and miracles in my life by being in the present moment, making space for contemplation, and sharing my intuitive wisdom when it arrives.

With Gate 8 in my unconscious Jupiter, my biggest “block” to stepping into that source of abundance is misdirected rebellion and inauthenticity.

The more I can transform rebellion into authenticity, the more present I am in my life. The more present I am, sharing what I know when I know it, the more abundance I create.

These are some of my core practices for abundance and Wild Success.

I’ve reached a point in my life where being inauthentic creates so much bitterness that I can’t do it anymore. I’m done with people-pleasing, masking, and trying to make everybody and their brother happy. I want my contribution to this world to be as authentic as humanly possible and that requires me to….be authentic!That is why I practice what I preach insidethe map portal. My practice is showing up authentically, rallying my inner resources and wholeness, even when other people don’t like it, have some bullshit thoughts about it, or want me to play small.

Otherwise, I become a rebelwithouta cause, destroying myself and everything in my path. That way of being doesn’t lead to more authenticity — it leads to less. And it wastes a metric fuck ton of energy.

When I waste energy on false rebellions, I have little left to discover what isactuallyauthentic, what my causereallyis, and where that rebelenergy can be channeled into somethingtrulyworthwhile.

And it fills my present moment with defensiveness, victim consciousness, and existential anguish.

In those triggered states, I don’t have access to the inner wisdom that allows my Gate 20 to be present and speak its truth now.

This awareness was a bitter pill to swallow. No pun intended.

I’m grateful to understand how Gate 8’s “low” frequency manifests in my life. That awareness, coupled with meeting those parts of myself with radical self-acceptance and unconditional love, has helped me transform rebellion into authentic contribution. Now, rebellion is simply a clue letting me know that a part of me believes that I must comply, and I know exactly how to handle that.

Of course, I can’t say, with any self-respect, that I am never rebellious for rebellion’s sake. That just isn’t true. Healing people pleasing is like peeling an onion. As one of the big layers is peeled off, smaller, more nuanced layers appear. The journey is about going deeper and deeper into the same shit.

It is all an opportunity to get curious, to notice how present I am, and where I might be getting caught in the victim mindset, looking for where to lay blame.

Rinse. Repeat.

### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 9 (Gene Key 9)

Gate 9 isundefinedin my chart. But, IamNeurodivergent (AuDHD) and have aProjector Aura, which means that I can focus like no other when something has captured my fascination and interest.

Add on my 5th line profile, definedheadandajna, andHuman Design Gate 62in my unconscious sun and you get someone who is a genius at breaking big ideas down, especially esoteric ones, into smaller, digestible, and practical concepts and tools.

You’ll get to feast on of all with theHuman Design Map + portal!

But when it comes to focusing on the important details to see a project to the end, like Gate 9, well, let’s just say I’m gathering wisdom. 😂

When I’m not mindful of it, I can easily get lost in details that don’t matter at all and completely miss details that do. I can quickly lose interest and need to consciously reconcile the big picture with the little picture.

As a business owner, that has presented some challenges!

My business and theHuman Design Mapare here to help you gain unforgettable clarity to live into your value and higher purpose. I show you – step-by-step – how to heal the emotional and spiritualshadowsthat “block” your authentic expression. When youtruly recognize and invite my guidance, I can guide you fromknowingyour Human Design design tohaving embodied experiencesof it’s highest expression and purpose.

When it comes to guiding people on their inner journey, I’m great. I can get to the heart of the matter – fast – and I blend Human Design mechanics with spiritual alchemy like no other.

But making sure thatone little checkboxis ticked in my tech stack isn’t exactly where I shine.

And, withHuman Design Gate 54in my midheaven, I’m here for it. I’ve embraced the idea that I am here to embody earth-bound prosperity as a critical part of my spiritual path.

So, the gate 9 details have becomegrist for the mill.

What I’ve come to discover is that the gate 9 kind of details are actually mirrors for healing and transformation.  Instead of pushing against them, being mad that I have to pay attention to them, or blowing them off all together, its apparent that the best path forward is to fully process feelings of shame that come up when I think I’m fucking everything up.

And probably more importantly, over time, it has become more and more obvious that I’m not supposed to do it alone.

Building a team has brought all of this into even greater clarity. I’ve had the deep honor of receiving help from some amazing people. By letting them shine in what they are genius at, I don’t have to be so focused on the parts that I’m not designed for.

I’ve even had the pleasure of having a team member with the full 9-52 channeldefined.

And holy mother of all that is. What a mirror! To see the gate 9 details revealed with such mastery is a sight to behold. It has shown me so clearly that I don’t have to be so ruggedly independent.

There really are people that can help and do what I’ve been trying to do at least 79 billion times better than I ever could. 🤯

And another person with the channel 12-22definedhas revealed so much about handling mistakes with so much grace. I really don’t have to be so hard on myself.

Just like I teach mymapclients, healing and transformation can only happen when we drop the judgment and self-criticism. Yes, being honest with ourselves is key. But we must do it with compassion, curiosity, and Grace. Those are the keys that unlock the heart of alchemical transformation.

(I deep dive on all channels AND alchemical transformation inside the Human Design Map portal.Get yours here.)

Understanding how we treat ourselves in the face of ourundefinedaspects is everything. We can be so fucking mean to ourselves about the supposedly inadequacies.

But when we lean into them and allow them topolish the mirror, they show us so much about what it means to be human. And reveal who we really are, what we need, and our best tools and resources for getting there.

When you stand in the Truth that your intentions and goals are worth taking time to be with the important details…

What tiny details really matter? And what tiny details don’t?

What do you need to do to remember to focus on what matters and let go of the rest?

### The Positive and Negative Sides of Human Design Gate 10

All energy in theHuman Design chart exists on a spectrum of potential.

On the “positive” end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 10 is the energy for deep self-love. Gate 10 understands and honors its needs, values, and desires and is a shining example of self-love.

On the “negative” end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 10 is the energy for people-pleasingand codependency. It ignores the wisdom of its emotions and ignores itsneeds and values.

You’ll learn about the surprising (but most effective) way to raise your energy frequency in theHuman Design Map + Portal.

In the meantime, start noticing when you are feeling hateful, inner judgement or like a people pleaser but don’t be an asshole to yourself. Treat yourself the way you would a small child – with love, curiosity, and understanding.

### My Personal Experience with Human Design Gate 10 (Gene Key 10)

Self-love was a foreign concept to me until my early thirties.

When I first came across the idea, like so many, I was confused and needed clarification about what it even means to love oneself.

First and foremost, I thought that self-love was undoubtedly selfish. I’d been conditioned to believe that ignoring my own needs and taking care of others (especially emotionally) was how I earned Gold Stars from “God.”

I also thought self-love meant I was conceited, full of myself, or completely narcissistic.

And, I was at a breaking point.

I had recently started my business and naively assumed that being in charge of my schedule would somehow magically make my life a land of fairy tales.

And, don’t get me wrong, there is no part of me that wants to go back to working for other people. I’m unemployable, at this point.

But, just like so many of the people who are drawn to my work with themap, I still believed that the answers were outside of me. I was convinced that a change in outer circumstances would fix everything that seemed broken.

I woke up to the realization that the answers are – and always have been – inside of me. And learning to love and accept myself was the way.

I knew that if I were to grow into my authenticity and step into my higher purpose, self-love was my next step. There was no other way around it. The way I was living was not working.

Let’s be honest.

You don’t end up addicted to drugs, alcohol, and sex with strangers because you love yourself, right?

No. You don’t.

So, I decided to believe all those inspirational quotes about putting on my oxygen mask first and decided that I would learn to love myself.

But that was when the “real block” to self-love showed up.

I thought that deciding to love myself would be like waving a magic wand; in a flash, my self-hatred, unhealthy habits (human design gate 5), and shitty boundaries (human design gate 37) would disappear into thin air.

And, I assure you, if I had such a wand, I’d sell it on the internet for millions of dollars. LOL.

However, it doesn’t work like that. And it isn’t supposed to.

In this game of Divine Hide and Seek, we are being called into ourselves. And anytime we areseekingoutside of ourselves for answers, the answers will keephiding.

In reality, self-love is about devotion to your inner knowing. It’s a practice that gets really messy and requires the tenacity to keep choosing self-love, even when all of the odds are stacked against you.

Self-love is a path of understanding yourself, your needs, your values, and your heartfelt desires and healing the “blocks” that prevent you from prioritizing those things in your life.

As you likely already know, yourHuman Design chartis a beautiful doorway into discovering what it means to love yourself. I would even go so far as to say Human Design is a shortcut!

(You’re in luck. I’m a literal master at teaching you how to “heal your blocks.” In theHuman Design Map, I’ll explain the most important parts of your design and teach you how to love yourself, even when life is handing you a shit sandwich inside the Human Design Map + Portal.Get your access here.)

Whether you use your Human Design as part of your journey into self-love, rest assured that it takes forgiveness, acceptance, patience, and radical honesty with yourself and others.

More importantly, it means you have to let people think whatever they want about you. Even if they think you are selfish, conceited, or full of yourself.

🤯🤯🤯

What other people think about you is none of your business.

As we move into the era of individual empowerment and the embodiment of spirit (2027 – 2438), it is essential to remember that other people’s thoughts, feelings, and actions are their own. And that their judgments of you areprojectionsof their own disintegratedshadows.

Your fear of other people thinking “negative” things about you, and judging the shit out of yourself because of it, are the “blocks” to unshakable self love.

The energy you need to move forward with self-love is bound up in those fears. And reclaiming those lost parts of yourself is where you find your freedom.

Every single time.

When you do what is right for you, no matter what other people think…

… Self-hatred transforms into self-respect…

…Unhealthy habits alchemize into conscious and higher alignment choices…

…Shitty boundaries transform into honesty and integrity.

This magical combination of energy allows self-love to permeate the essence of your being, and you become a lighthouse that empowers others to do the same. It is gate 10 in action.

I’ll teach you “how” inside theHuman Design Map + Portal.

On my own path, for which there are still plenty of miles to go, I’ve discovered that the more I practice self-love, the more I say yes to myself, and the more I create the space necessary for self-understanding, the more fun and meaningful my life is.

And ironically enough, the more I love myself, the easier it is for me to show up for others. By giving from the overflow of my full cup, I can be in genuine service without the bitterness and resentment that filled my earlier years.

I now trust that the more I give myself, the more I have to give to others. And that what other people think about my path is about them.

It can only be that way.

### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 11 (Gene Key 11)

Gate 11 is especially interesting to me.

It isundefinedin my chart, but I haveHuman Design Gate 56hanging in mydefinedthroat. And, probably more importantly, I have a small split between my ajna and throat; gates17,23, or 11 will bridge that split.

I talk about splits inside the Nine Centers Guide, which is inside theHuman Design Mapportal. But, essentially, a small split means that you only have one gate that will transform your chart from split definition to single definition. That means that gate 11 is a highly electromagnetic gate for me and, as with anyundefined places in our charts, is a place where I’ve been gathering wisdom my whole life. It has shown me a lot about how our imagination plays such an important role in the stories we tell (56).

Often, we think that our imagination (11) and stories (56) are “the truth.”

And with my defined head and ajna (via the channel of awareness61–24), I’ve been wrestling with the concept of Truth my whole life. “Truth” is a deeply subjective part of this mystery called life.

Recognizing that Truth is subjective brings me the most peace of mind. No oneknowshow we got here, why we came, and what happens when we die.

The only thing we ever really have is our inner wisdom and sense of resonance, and choosing to trust leads us to our growth edge.

We can choose to believe in our inner Truth. Or we can choose to believe in our conditioning.

While it can hurt to realize it initially, it’s all a choice.

Your thoughts, beliefs, ideas, opinions, and yes, even your “Truth” is 100% optional. The sentences in your mind aren’t set in stone – they are malleable like clay.

And when we are caught up in our stories (gate 56), especially the “negative” ones, it clouds our ability to make peace with other people having a different Truth. And this can destroy our relationships.

(Inside theHuman Design MapPortal, I have a quick and dirty guide on decoding Human Design relationship charts. If you are a map customer, the guide is in the section called “Quick and Dirty Guides”.)

For most of my life, I held a story (gate 56) that belonging was dependent on shared beliefs and values. I used to believe that to “get along” with people, we had to think and believe the same things. And that if we disagreed, then it was a recipe for trouble in the relationship.

Anytime there was even a semblance of disagreement, I would whip up far-out scenarios in my imagination. I would visualize the worst possible outcome and weave doom and gloom stories.

A self fulfilling prophecy.

What I’ve come to understand, though, is that differences are NOT the problem. It is the attachment to “Truth” that is the real troublemaker.

When we are attached to something, we depend on it to create our feelings and emotions. And when that thing isn’t there, we spiral into hopelessness, despair, fear, and shame.

When we need other people to agree with us, we depend on their agreement to feel safe, secure, whole, or worthy.

That attachment is a 100% faulty foundation for relationships. If your feelings depend on how other people think, feel, and align with your beliefs and ideals, you are truly up shit’s creek.

Attachment cannot build growth and expansion – it will crumble.

We are moving into the era of individual empowerment (2027 – 2438), it is time for our foundations to be built upon “the truth” of  inner wisdom and resonance. And in letting go of the attachment to how our individual “truth” lands with others.

To begin using our imagination (11) to weave up stories (gate 56) about empowered relationships that thrive when each individual is empowered.

No doubt, life will invite you, time and time again, to make peace with not reallyknowing. And, in doing so, we make space for a new vision beyond our wildest imagination.

“Spillin’ out like waterLike a mountain gave a daughterSurrender never felt so goodI grew it strong like a sacred woodAnd now the roots are running deeperAll illusion getting weakerYou see, the wisdom it don’t come from readingIt comes from believingWhat I know, is that I don’t knowAnd now I dance and I sing and I live fullI give it all to the call of the unknownAho”

Trevor Hall, The Fruitful Darkness, What I Know (on SpotifyORlive in concert on youtube)

The growth edge is in exploring the attachments and letting them go, piece by piece, and building a foundation of belief and faith simply because you trust yourself.

In that space, the mind becomes a fun playground of imagination, curiosity, and awe rather than a boulder weighing you down.

Magick.

### Now it’s your turn to contemplate Gate 11

When you stand in the truth that the gifts of gate 11 are available to you, whether you have it in your chart or not…

Right now, in this moment, what is your Truth?

When you think about the possibility of your Truth being wrong, what feelings come up for you?

In what ways do you need others to agree with you?

In what ways are you attached to your beliefs, thoughts, and ideas?

What feelings underlie your attachments to your Truth?

How can you create those feelings for yourself without being dependent on external sources?

My hope is that you will make some space to really reflect on these questions and let your Truth rise to the surface. And in that, you will find healing, strength, and power to live your Truth.

### The Positive and Negative Sides of Human Design Gate 12

All energy in theHuman Design chart exists on a spectrum of potential.

On the “positive” end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 12 is the energy for expressing emotions through art, especially the art of language, in a highly refined way. Gate 12 wants nothing more than to pour everything it has into art and share it with the world. It has “good taste” and idealistic visions of beauty, art, andGrace.

On the “negative” end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 12 is the energy for holding people, organizations, and art to impossible standards of perfection. It can easily push other people’s buttons with its words and can even have a bit of a superiority complex because of its highly refined “palate” in life.

You’ll learn about the surprising (but most effective) way to raise your energy frequency in theHuman Design Map + Portal.

In the meantime, start noticing when you are using words as weapons but don’t be an asshole to yourself. Treat yourself the way you would a small child – with love, curiosity, and understanding.

### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 12 (Gene Key 12)

Gate 12 is undefined in my chart, but it’s one of the ones I find myself contemplating again and again. Like all of Human Design, what keeps me coming back isn’t just the mechanics — it’s the golden threads between the correspondences that create the puzzle we call the bodygraph.

Some of the correspondences for Gate 12 are that it’s in Gemini, which is ruled by Mercury and is mutable. It’s in the throat center in the Human Design chart. And because it connects to a motor center, the solar plexus, via Gate 22, it’s a “manifesting” gate.

Let’s break that down.

### Gemini, Ruled By Mercury

I’ve talked before about how most of the throat gates are in Gemini. And it tracks, right?

Gemini is Mercury’s domain. Mercury was the God of Commerce. He loaded up his metaphorical cart and brought valuable goods to the market. But more than simply delivering them, hecommunicatedtheir value. He shaped perception. He told the story of why they mattered.

And even deeper than that, he was a shapeshifter. A trickster. A poet. A magician. He moved between worlds, translated meaning, and cloaked deep truths in metaphor so they could be received by the hearts that needed them.

Language was more than expression. It was his tool of transmission. It was how he manifested.

### The Throat Center & Manifesting in Human Design

In Human Design, the throat is where manifestation happens. But, true to the mercurial roots of the throat, manifesting isn’t about vision boards and good vibes.

When we are talking about manifesting in Human Design, we are talking about how energy moves from the head, ajna, will, spleen, G, heart, sacral, root, and solar plexus. The energy on the inside of the body is moving out into the world.

A very, very (probably over simplified example) is crying.

Crying is sadness made visible. You can now touch the sadness with your hands. It becomes more than a sensation in the body, it becomes the sound of sobs, the taste of salt, and ruins your mascara.

That energy expressing itself in the “real” world is manifestation in Human design.

(✨Side note: If you’re a Manifestor or Manifesting Generator, I talk more about this in yourHuman Design Map.)

Whether through words, actions, deeds, or “art,” most of the energy manifesting through the throat communicates to the world who you are and what you are about. It’s Mercury’s way of loading up your metaphorical cart and “marketing” it to the world.

### What Does That Have To Do With Gate 12?

In case you didn’t know, Gate 12 has gone through a few name changes in theHuman Design Map. It started asThe Poet. ThenThe Fine Artist. The most recent change wasThe Artisan of Life.

But that evolution wasn’t about me changing my mind.

It was me listening to what Mercury was telling me, straight out of the mouths of mymapclients.

People with Gate 12 defined — even in their incarnation cross — would say things like:

But I’m not a poet.

I don’t make art. I don’t even really like it.

I’m terrible with words. I actually don’t talk much.

And my Gemini Moon (in Gate 16, naturally)was nothaving that. Because I knew that it meant my words – my communication – weren’t landing.

They were putting people in unnecessary boxes. Perhaps even perpetuating the very people pleasing, pretending, and putting words in their mouths. And when that happens, your energy gets misdirected and cannot “manifest” in its most potent, purposeful form.

And that is the last thing I want to contribute to.

I’m all about liberating you from all the ways in which you sacrifice your integrity for the fruitless venture of “making” other people happy. And teaching you the skills necessary to leverage and channel your energy in ways that leave you satisfied, successful, peaceful, and delightfully surprised by the magick of life.

(That’s the deeper work we do in theMap and Portal— not just naming energies, but helping you direct them toward what’s actually authentic to you.)

So, when the words don’t land, and you don’t feel seen, it’s time for me to listen even more deeply. And to put my ego aside to make the chart even more applicable in the lives of people living real-world lives everyday.

And as Mercury spoke, I heard:

Gate 12 is movement.And movement is art.And art is life, made manifest.

Yes, sometimes it will look literal — painting, poetry, dance, whatever. Things you can touch, taste, smell, and see.

But maybe it is more about making your life your greatest work of art. It’s about being discerning in how you move and letting it be true to what is actually inside of you — instead of moving in ways that others have conditioned you to move.

Maybe, just maybe, it’s Mercury doing what Mercury does best.

As he shape-shifts, he tells us that it doesn’t matter what we say or do on the outside. Because energy does not lie.

What matters is the inner energy that drives the expression—the energy being communicated, the value being exchanged, and the transformative lesson wrapped in the metaphor of being human.

Only time will tell ifThe Artisan of Lifewill be the archetypal name that sticks.

But what I know for sure is that Mercury has his ways. And that, even when it doesn’t seem like it on the outside, life always moves us towards expanding our capacity for authenticity, purpose, Grace, and expression.

This life, the one we are living here and now, is our Masterpiece.

Message received, Mercury. Message received.

And if you’re ready to hear the call of your soul so loud and clear that you cannot unsee its wisdom and truth,invite me here.

### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 13 (Gene Key 13)

Gate 13 undefined in my chart, but interestingly enough, it is connected to recognizing my gifts with theHuman Design system.

As a5/2 profile, I’m in the “double projection field,” which essentially means that people don’t see me – they see the projection of their hopes, dreams, and expectations. And an essential part of mykarmic roleis to be able to “call myself out” on my natural gifts and use them accordingly. Otherwise, I waste all of my energy on trying to live up to othersprojections.

And, depending on how long you’ve been in my orbit, you may not know that I came to Human Design kicking and screaming. I didn’t plan on Human Design being a part of my energy healing business and definitely had no idea that it would eventually become the “face” of my business. It took me a minute to see that I have something unique to say in the Human Design space.

In hindsight, I realize that, like so many otherprojector types, I was deeply resistant to being seen, recognized, and invited in natural and easy ways. Due to decades of conditioning, I was deeply attached to the story that it was hard and complicated to be successful.

Many synchronicities helped medeconditionresistance to ease, but one of them was connected to gate 13. (Be sure to also read my post onHuman Design gate 15, which tells the story the started it all.)

I was listening to some music on Spotify and felt the heavy weight of the lyrics. I could sense the burden of being a keeper of the secrets and not knowing what to do with the betrayal, lies, and shame.

The thought popped into my head:

This song sounds like gate 13.

That may not be surprising if you’ve come to know me because of my depth of knowledge (and sheer fascination) with thehuman design gates. Today, I can rattle off endless information about every gate in the chart. I can tell you all of its mechanical details, wax poetic about the beauty of its full spectrum, and tell you what it means in different placements.

(Inside theHuman Design Mapportal, there are all sorts of fun ways we work with gates and channels, including business, relationships, and transits.)

But, at that time, I couldn’t tell you much about them – not even the ones in my own chart.

So, being the Human Design stalker I am, I looked up the artists’ birth information, ran their chart, and saw gate 13 in their conscious sun.

Looking at that chart, I had a moment of calling myself out. Through the mystery of Grace, the gates were seemingly hard coded into my cells. I could hear them speak.

Until then, I’d had multiple moments when looking at charts where I could see that I had a unique understanding of energy. And that Human Design gives me a shortcut because now I have language for expressing what I always intuitively knew.

But, this moment was different because of its precision (shout out togate 62in my unconscious sun ;)).

It was crystal clear that I have a special connection with Human Design, and gate 13 was working its magick on me.

It was like I’d whispered into the ears of the Universe and told it that I was ready. I would no longer hold shame about the “woo-woo” nature of my gifts, the illogical way that I know things, and, most importantly, I began forgiving myself for waiting this long to claim my genius.

From there, I’ve gone on to create wild, wild success.

Every day, with theHuman Design Map + Portal, my blog,substack, and emails, I help others understand and own their genius. I help them stand boldly in who they are and to clear the “blocks” that get in the way of their higher purpose. It blows my mind constantly.

But that is the beauty of…

….having your secrets held with unconditional love and forgiveness.

…being able to stand vulnerable before a listening ear and knowing it will all be OK.

…giving voice to your deepest, most intimate parts and trusting that it will be met with empathy and Grace.

That is what happened for me that day. And I will never forget it.

### The Positive and Negative Sides of Human Design Gate 14

All energy in theHuman Design chart exists on a spectrum of potential.

On the “positive” end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 14 is the energy for prosperity, dream work, and inspiration. It shows you the path for making money by following your dreams.

On the “negative” spectrum, Human Design Gate 14 is the energy for getting stuck in the fear that you won’t be able to make your dreams come true. This can create a life where you feel stuck doing things you hate for the sake of making money.

You’ll learn about the surprising (but most effective) way to raise your energy frequency in theHuman Design Map + Portal.

In the meantime, start noticing when you are feeling incapable, helpless or enslaved but don’t be an asshole to yourself. Treat yourself the way you would a small child – with love, curiosity, and understanding.

### My Personal Experience with Human Design Gate 14 (Gene Key 14)

Gate 14 isundefinedin my chart and as aProjector aura type, so is mysacral center.

When I am unconscious of my energy boundaries, I can easily get caught up in the sacral energy of the people around me and amplify it. And, let me tell you, when someone is on the “high” end of thespectrum, that experience is amazing. But when they are on the “low” end, not so much.

My experience is that, as a society, most people are on the low end of the gate 14 spectrum. There is so, so, so much bound up in our relationship to money. Money, while originally intended as an easy way to exchange value, has become synonymous with safety, security, and sustenance.

Which means that, collectively, in an attempt to stay safe, secure, and fed, we have tucked our purpose away and are exchanging the precious moments of our lives for money. And, on the flip side of that, we are also told that money can’t buy happiness or that it isn’t “spiritual” to want money.

I get messages to those effects in theHuman Design Mapportal all the time.

Money seems to be a huge point of contention when learning to trust ourselves and becoming more authentic in our lives. We “need” the money and we deeply believe that staying where we are is the safest thing to do. And we beat ourselves up – feeling selfish, guilty, and unevolved – for even caring about it

It’s tricky. Nuanced. And feels incredibly complex. Maybe even hopeless.

I get it.

I was raised in poverty, scarcity, and lack. It’s like the stress of it is encoded into my cells. And, yet, I was also raised to believe that money was the root of all evil and that wanting more money proved I was a “bad” person (in the eyes of God).

And I’ve felt those same conflicted feelings. I’ve desperately needed more money to pay my bills. While simultaneously feeling shameful for believing that money would solve all my problems.

I’ve heard similar stories inside themapportal as well. People tell me things like:

- There isn’t a way to make money doing what I love.

- I have to be responsible. If I did what I love, I’d be broke.

- I don’t want to prioritize making money over my authenticity but I do. And I hate it.

Some people are even drawn into Human Design from the false promise that “living your design” will make you rich. Which is so ironic because Ra Uru Hu, the original channeler of theHuman Design System, taught that the we make money through our not self.

Personally, I don’t subscribe to either of those beliefs. The whole concept of “living your design” is marketing. Period. And the idea that we can only make money through thenot selfis simplya projectionof the spiritual idea that money is evil.

Like I said before, it’s complicated. There are markers in theHuman Design chartthat can help us explore our relationship to money. And it also offers us insights and tools for becoming more authentic.

But, ultimately, creating prosperity begins with being radically honest with ourselves about our internal patterns with money and work. It’s about looking at our:

- values and how aligned our financial habits of earning, spending, and investing are with those values

- sense of self worth and owning the value we bring to “the market.”

- capacity for expansion and receiving. Does it feel safe to experience true abundance?

- resourcefulness and trusting ourselves to tap into it, no matter the bottom line.

- level of responsibility for our outcomes and willingness to let go of blame.

- relationship with pressure and how discerning we are in leveraging it correctly.

- where we have unconscious internalized oppression and our relationship with power

- codependency and hanging our hopes on a savior.

- faith, trust, and belief.

And, probably some things I’m not even aware of. But, what i know for sure is that as we explore and find Truth, making a change is necessary. Even if it is teeny tiny.

You don’t need to burn your whole life down. In fact, in the MAP Method for Deconditioning (which is included with theHuman Design Map), I recommend micro changes and deliberate expansion of your capacity to make uncomfortable changes. A plane that shifts 1° ends up in an entirely different place.

As we do that internal work, the outer world will change. It can only be that way.

As above, so below.

### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 15 (Gene Key 15)

As a writer who tells many personal stories, I aim to balance sharing what is true for me and the truth that all stories aren’t mine to tell.

Finding this balance seems the trickiest when I’ve had a profound revelation involving someone who either cannot speak for themselves or who, for various reasons, doesn’t want their side of the story told.

This particular story is a combination of all of those things.

It’s a story that symbolizes one of the most healing insights I’ve ever been blessed to receive. It is a story that I know must be told.

Let’s start at the beginning.

WithHuman Design Gate 28in my chart 4 times, my life has been riddled with the existential fear that my life has no meaning or purpose, and healing that story is one of the key drivers in what I do inside the​Human Design Map & Portal​.

A therapist once told me that people with stories like mine jump off of bridges. An astrologer told me she’d need a stiff drink to read my chart. A Human Design “intuitive” once told me I should give up on making money, file for unemployment, and play video games for the rest of my life.

So, to say that I’ve experienced a lot of trauma would be an understatement. I’ve been shocked and shaken to my core more times than I can count (Human Design Gate 51 in my Conscious Earth). And I’ve wallowed in seemingly needless suffering for as long as I can remember.

I often look back on my life and cannot believe it’s only been one lifetime. And I’m no stranger to wondering how I will ever keep going.

All along the way, I’ve searched for my purpose and deeply doubted my ability to make a difference in the world.

​Even after over a decade of receiving mind-blowing praise — clients who’ve said I’m a miracle worker, or that I’ve made lifetimes of self-doubt disappear into thin air, or that they finally know what it feels like to experience their innate wholeness — I never really believed that I had anything to offer.

​And then, at the end of April 2020, I got one of the covetedProjector Invitations.

At that point, I was deep into my personal experiment with Human Design. I had been having many behind-the-scenes conversations with my colleagues, friends, and private clients, but I had zero intentions of doing anything “official” with it in my business. And I definitely had no idea of the wild success I’d experience with the​Human Design Map & Portal​.

At that time, I did private coaching for creatives who struggled with shame, self-worth, and feeling “not good enough.”

But, true to myprojector aura, people started asking me if they could pay me to interpret their Human Design.

And I kept saying no.

At that time, a part of me still believed that making money had to be much harder. That part of me thought that because Human Design came so naturally and easily to me—to the point that it seemed like “everyone understands this already”—it had no value in the real world.

But on that fateful Thursday, April 30, 2020, someone I love and deeply respect metaphorically knocked me upside the head and insisted that I let her give me money to make the first​Human Design Map​.

I sent her an invoice, she paid it instantly, and on Saturday, May 2, I got to work on her​map​.

As I sat there, surrounded by myHuman Design and Gene Keys books, highlighters, pencils, and my dot grid notebook, I began writing about her incarnation cross, and tears were streaming down my face.

I translated Human Design’s harsh and often disempowering language into pure, empowering magic.

I had no idea how I was doing it. It was just burning through me like aHoly Fire.

Something inside me came alive – something I had never known was there.

With no exaggeration, I say that for the first time in my life, I KNEW I had something to offer the world.

With every fiber of my being, I knew what I was doing meant something. And I knew that everyone on the planet deserved to see themselves in the light of Grace and that, by the great mystery of all that is, that light was shining through me.

A fire was lit inside of me. And I could not wait for Monday to come. This profound sense of purpose changed everything for me.

And then, my world flipped upside down.

The next morning, May 3, 2020, withbooksand pens still strewn across my desk, I woke up to missed calls from my sister and a text message saying to call her ASAP.

My heart sank.

She picked up the phone, and she said:

Bryan passed away last night.

I said:

Wait, is this really happening?

It was not computing in my brain.

See, Bryan was one of my younger brothers. And my other younger brother, Ronnie, had also tragically died many years before. And my brain did not want to accept that I’d lost not just one younger brother but two.

But, it was true. I wasn’t dreaming. Under more tragic circumstances, Bryan was gone.

He was 37 years old and left behind a wife and two daughters.

I immediately began packing my things and headed to North Carolina to be with my family.

Just over a week later, we held Bryan’s funeral right next to Ronnie’s grave.

A couple of hundred people were there, many of whom I had never met.

I listened closely as so many of them honored him by sharing the impact that he’d made on their lives.

Time and time again, they said the same thing about him. They said:

Bryan was full of heart.

And he was.

I didn’t know it then, but Bryan had gate 15 in his conscious sun.

His energy was big. And bold. And you could hear him coming from a mile away.

He gave zero fucks about what other people thought he should do with his life, and he loved hard.

On that day, it was palpable. He was a Vessel of Love, and he’d left exactly that mark on the world.

But this story doesn’t end there.

There was also a sharp contrast between what was being said in those mini-eulogies and the whispers among the crowd.

Just as people shared that Bryan had had a profound and healing impact on their lives, many well-meaning people wondered if Bryan was in Hell—as in, burning for eternity with the “devil.”

On the outside, Bryan lived the kind of life many people would not (and did not) approve of. Those parts of the story are not mine to tell. But, I will say that he was often seen as doing life wrong.

And while I don’t believe in Hell or eternal damnation, I, too, had been guilty of judging the way that Bryan lived his life. Until his funeral, I would have never looked at his life and said that he was someone who was living his purpose. A big part of me absolutely believed that he should be doing things differently.

But I also knew that those people who shared about his big heart were right. His life was a mess, AND he was Love walking.

Man, I miss his hugs.

In the contrast, I could see that he was the embodiment of the BOTH/AND.

When I returned home, I ran his Human Design chart for the first time; it truly stunned me.

In his chart, his G center and Will center are defined, which combined are the heart chakra in the Hindu chakra system.

And with Gate 15 in his conscious sun, his incarnation cross was the Vessel of Love.

Bryan was, in fact, full of heart.

Looking at that chart, a deep peace washed over me.

The part of me that had longed for purpose and meaning my whole life surrendered to this knowing:

Bryan was living his purpose.

Maybe it didn’t look like it on the outside.

But he was. And he always was. There was never a time he wasn’t.

Even when he was doing things we often believed he shouldn’t.

Bryan was living his purpose.

Everything I’d believed about purpose shattered. In a flash, the story was completely rewritten.

Purpose isn’t something that we find. It isn’t something that happens to a select few. It isn’t something we have to strive for, achieve, or prove in an attempt to earn worthiness on this Earth. It isn’t even about what we are doing for other people.

Our purpose is to live life — as ourselves with our conscious sun as our north star — and our real work is to recognize it; to accept the Divine Invitation. It is to open our hearts and minds and to expand our capacity to receive the bounty of who we really are. It is to allow ourselves to revel in the magic that flows through each and every one of us. To know that there is nothing to prove, earn, or be to be worthy of Love and Grace.

We are LOVE walking already.

​As my heart cracked open, I knew I needed to tell everyone who would listen that you could end your quest to “find” your life purpose with a decision.

You must decide that your purpose is already alive and well. You must decide that you’ll allow yourself to experience it. You must decide to recognize it and receive it.

You must decide that living your life — as yourself — is the purpose. You must decide to love yourself through the times you forget how beautifully powerful and purposeful you are.

These decisions will free you from the despair of purposelessness.

They will empower you to alchemize your darkest moments into a rare jewel encased in 24K Gold.

On that day, I made that decision for myself. I decided that who I am is enough. I decided I was no longer available for the story of brokenness, unworthiness, or purposelessness. I decided to surrender to my gifts.

And, in time, I returned to working on that very firstHuman Design Mapwith more devotion than I ever knew was possible.

I have zero doubt that people need this work, and they need it in a way that only I can deliver.

Because everyone deserves to see, feel, and experience the purpose simmering under the surface in every thought, feeling, and action in their world.

The features of the​map​have changed a lot since then. It went from a simple PDF to a 100+ page written guide, a robust portal with plenty of follow-up support, and the MAP Method for Deconditioning course, which teaches you my three-step process for getting in tune with your inner wisdom, healing the shit that blocks you, and how to make aligned choices, even in the face of adversity. It is the “how” of overcoming people-pleasing and living on purpose.​Check it out here​.

Bryan has been by my side the whole time. HisWild Heartis cheering me. And he is proud of the legacy he left behind, which was this:

We are all Love. We are all the stuff of stars. We are all under the blanket of Grace.

### The Positive and Negative Sides of Human Design Gate 16

All energy in theHuman Design chart exists on a spectrum of potential.

On the “positive” end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 16 is the energy for talent, skill, enthusiasm and the commitment to mastery. Gates 16 believes that practice does not make perfect – it makes mastery and the grit of mastery is infinitely more rewarding than perfection. With this attitude firmly in place, its make it’s mark in the world with the mastery of it’s craft.

On the other end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 16 is the energy for perfectionism or hiding who you are as a result of unhealed shame. It can easily become obsessed with the “right” way to do things or waiting to “be ready” before starting things.

You’ll learn about the surprising (but most effective) way to raise your energy frequency in theHuman Design Map + Portal.

In the meantime, start noticing when you are holding yourself back in shame but don’t be an asshole to yourself. Treat yourself the way you would a small child – with love, curiosity, and understanding.

### My Personal Experience with Human Design Gate 16 (Gene Key 16)

BothHuman Design Gate 48and Gate 16 are defined on the conscious side of my chart, creating the full channel of the wavelength.

The 16, in particular, is defined in my conscious moon in line 6.

Anytime we have a gate in line 6, we will go through three distinct phases with that energy in our lives. (You canread about the Human Design Profiles and Lines here.)

The first phase, from birth to the first Saturn Return (around age 28), looks more like a 3rd line. There are lots of mistakes and failed experiments. But, unlike the 3rd line, the 6th line mostly learns the emotional resilience skills necessary to“bounce back” from failure in the second phase.

Note:Inside the​Human Design Map Portal​, you will find a course called Transits & Returns, where I explain how those are interpreted in Human Design in a bit more detail.

The second phase begins at the first Saturn Return and lasts through the Chiron Return (around age 50). During this time, the 6th line goes “on the roof” to gain perspective, heal from the wounds of the first phase, and develop wisdom about their experiences.

By the third phase, after the Chiron Return, the sixth line steps into its role-model energy and becomes an embodiment of the wisdom it developed while on the roof.

These are the same phases anyone with a 6 in their profile will go through. If you have a 6 in your profile (3/6, 4/6, 6/2, 6/3), I will explain them in my post onprofiles and linesand even more thoroughly in the​Human Design Map​.

These phases are not hard and fast rules, of course.

Because we are more than our Human Design, things like trauma, social structures,our capacity, and environment play huge roles in moving through life.

The sixth line, in particular, is very sensitive to social influence. In our current culture, we aren’t encouraged to step back from life to gather perspective. We are encouraged to go, do, be, and have all the things all the time.

Living by that conditioning can prolong the healing that needs to happen for any of the 6th line energies in our chart.

When I originally wrote this contemplation, I was 47 and still “on the roof” with all the line 6 energy in my chart. I am not a 6th-line profile; my profile is 5/2. But as I approach my Chiron Return, I can definitely feel the places in my chart where the 6th line is defined.

In gate 16, it has only been in the last few years that I’ve gained some perspective on old patterns of perfectionism and my obsession with getting things right.

Gate 48plays perfectly into this. Its “lower” expression can become paralyzed because you believe that you don’t know enough.

So, when you combine the belief that you don’t know enough with the belief that you need to make everything perfect, you have the perfect storm of not creating much.

You end up going in circles, often reinventing the wheel, and never “feeling ready” to move forward.

This pattern became clear to me once I started my business in 2009.

I would literally obsess about everything I put out into the world.

One of the first coaching programs I ever developed was calledAbundant Self Care, which included videos.

I had no experience filming or editing videos, and my inner perfectionist was running the show.

I genuinely believed I should be able to sit down, turn on the camera, say everything perfectly from memory, and upload the video without a single edit…on the first try.

And I was so mad and ashamed because that wasn’t how it went. Ever.

I remember talking to my business coach about it; she told me it was OK for it not to be perfect.

God rest her soul, she said something that changed my life:

“Done” is better than “perfect.”

She told me that it was more important to start helping people by just putting something out than never producing anything.

I will be forever grateful for her perspective and for how it started mydeconditioning processaround perfectionism.

I wish I could say I never struggle with perfectionism anymore, but that would be a straight-up lie.

I can still become obsessed over tiny details (Human Design Gate 9) and throw the baby out with the bathwater when things aren’t “just right.” True to gate 16 being defined in my moon, it is deeply intertwined with how I relate to my inner world.

I can’t even tell you how many times my inner perfectionist has told me that the​Human Design Map​is shit and that I should burn it all down to the ground. Thankfully, I am surrounded by people who recognize me and can remind me as many times as it takes that my work is incredibly valuable to the world. And that perfection isn’t required, or even preferred, to be of deep service to others.

As I have gotten older, gained more perspective, and learned how to self-recognize, it is much easier to catch myself in those patterns and stop them in their tracks.

And I have even started to enjoy the process of practice and repetition (aka mastery).

I’ve come to embrace the idea of “b minus work,” letting others see me as not being perfect and putting things out into the world because they will help people rather than fluff up my ego.

At the end of the day, I can see that perfectionism is actually an epic waste of energy.

Perfectionism does nothing for the people I am here to help. It gets me all up in my head, bypassing the wisdom of my body and soul. And it completely blocks my ability to master anything.

And that is so good to know.

If you struggle with perfectionism, you’ll love the process I teach inside theHuman Design Map & Portal. It will help you learn how to leverage your energy and get out of your own way.

### The Positive and Negative Sides of Human Design Gate 17

All energy in theHuman Design chart exists on a spectrum of potential.

On the “positive” end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 17 is the energy for finding logical solutions, answers, and ideas. Gate 17 is aware that everyone thrives when everyone thrives, and tends to be fair, unbiased, and committed to finding win-wins with it’s solutions.

On the other end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 17 is the energy for being dogmatic, authoritarian, or mentally inflexible. It can create disorder or disharmony by being narrow-minded can easily get trapped in black and white thinking.

You’ll learn about the surprising (but most effective) way to raise your energy frequency in theHuman Design Map + Portal.

In the meantime, start noticing when you are feeling authoritative, unfair or dogmatic but don’t be an asshole to yourself. Treat yourself the way you would a small child – with love, curiosity, and understanding.

### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 17 (Gene Key 17)

Gate 17 is undefined in my chart, but it is one of the most significant undefined gates.

First, gate 62, the other side of the channel of acceptance, is defined in the unconscious sun of myincarnation cross.

I also have a small split definition between my throat and ajna, which can be bridged by gates 17, 23, or 11.

Those two things combined make gate 17 the most electromagnetically attractive gate.

Good thing I married a man with a hanging gate 17. 🤣

It’s been an interesting experience to get to know this gate.

What I’ve discovered is that I was holding a lot of “not-self” themes around gate 17.

I always thought that I needed to have an opinion about EVERYTHING. I wanted to be asked about my opinions, even when I didn’t have one. And I often felt bitter and resentful towards others who seemed to know and express their views easily.

Deconditioninggate 17 hasn’t been a matter of never having an opinion. I still have plenty to go around. (Readthis,this, andthis.)

The highest potential of our undefined places is becoming wise about how, when, and why we use that energy—and practicing non-attachment when we don’t consistently experience that energy.

With gate 17, I discovered that I only need strong opinions sometimes – when it matters. I can have opinions without making other people’s opinions wrong. And it’s beneficial for me to take in all sides before forming opinions instead of just looking at one side.

Gate 61 in my unconscious earth also plays a role here.

What I know is that I don’t know.

Truth isn’t objective- it is subjective.

Everyone is weaving their personal fabric of reality.

Embodying this is freedom.

And it has given me so much energy back– especially regarding my work with Human Design andthe map.

Like every other topic on the planet, the Human Design space is FULL of opinions and people ready to tell you that you are doing it wrong. And I’ve had my fair share of people “coming at me” about how I approach the system.

There is no way I’d be able to handle the criticism if I was attached to my opinion being “right.”

Instead, I can take full ownership that I’m not trying to be right. I always tell my map clients to take what they can use and leave the rest.

As a 5/2, I aim to make Human Design practical, simple and empowering.

My ultimate intention is to help others trust themselves and embody their personal truth – even when it doesn’t match their chart.

I don’t believe that Human Design is the answer to all of life’s problems. It is a tool that helps us focus our attention inward – and that’s it.

Other people have different opinions.

And it isn’t up to me to decide whether that is right or wrong. It is up to me to trust myself and the path before me.

I pray that I continue to deepen into non-attachment around my opinions. And to let myself off the hook for managing the opinions of others.

When you stand in the truth that the gifts of the 17 are always available to you (whether it’s defined in your chart or not)…

Are you attached to your opinions?

Do you ever find yourself trapped in black and white thinking?

In what ways do you benefit when you believe that you are right and others are wrong?

What if you let go of the idea that opinions are either right or wrong?

I encourage you to take some time with these questions. Take them out into your world and let their answers reveal themselves to you. Intend for deeper levels of clarity about gate17.

### The Positive and Negative Sides of Human Design Gate 18

All energy in theHuman Design chart exists on a spectrum of potential.

On the “positive” end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 18 is the energy for seeing the wholeness in all things. Gate 18 understands that the only thing that needs to be “fixed” is the stories we tell ourselves about ourselves and about others. It easily sees the stories of brokenness that are playing out in the collective and helps others to transform those stories into wholeness.

On the “negative” end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 18 is the energy for beating yourself up with negative self-talk or being hyper-focused on the flaws and mistakes of others. It drives complaining, gossiping, worrying, and needing to be right. This, of course, only perpetuates stories of brokenness.

### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 18 (Gene Key 18)

My unconscious Pluto is in gate 18.6. My conscious Pluto is in gate 48 (the gate of depth) and is conjunct with my conscious sun (human design gate 57).

On the conscious side, Pluto is the place where we go through a rebirth in our lives. It takes us into the deepest shadows of our psyche and brings us out the other side with a new sense of integrity and wholeness.

When Pluto conjunct the sun, it brings a whole new level of intensity to the (astrology) chart. It creates a drive for “truth”, depth, inner transformation, and self-realization that is unrelenting.

The unconscious side of our chart represents the “wound”, trauma pattern, or shadow that “blocks” the full expression of the conscious side.

The potent combination I have brings my absolute obsession with shadow integration work and self-realization into sharp focus.

(I teach shadow integration as an essential part of deconditioning once you have yourHuman Design Map.)

And helps me to see more deeply how gate 18 in line 6 has played its part.

When I was around 30, I was in my very first training as a coach. Debbie Ford (may she rest in power) was a guest lecturer and I became enraptured with her work.

My copy of her bookThe Dark Side of the Light Chasersis well worn with highlights, underlines, and notes.

Her work is what brought my conscious awareness ofwhat the shadow is. It opened my eyes to the idea that we are already whole and that the whole word lives inside of us.

The part that I was most enamored with was her thoughts about judging others. In the book she writes:

“Once we accept the fact that each of us embodies all the traits in the universe, we can stop pretending that we are not everything…

We adopt prejudices from our families and friends. “You’re different because you are fat and I am skinny. I am smart and you are stupid. I am timid and you are brave. I am passive and you are aggressive. I am loud and you are soft spoken.”

These beliefs maintain the illusion that we are separate. They create internal as well as external barriers that keep us from embracing the totality of our being. They keep us pointing fingers at others.

The key is to understand that there is nothing we can see or perceive that we are not.

If we did not possess a certain quality, we could not recognize it in another.

If you are inspired by someone’s courage, it is a reflection of the courage in you. If you think someone’s selfish, you can be sure that you are capable of demonstrating the same amount of selfishness.

Although these qualities will not be expressed all the time, we each have the ability to act out any quality we see.” ~ Debbie Ford

In hindsight, I can see that this was the beginning of “being on the roof” with gate 18 in line 6. I was at the end of my first Saturn Return; it was a pivotal time when I began to unwind my inner and outer critic.

(I cover how to interpret planetary seasons, such as the Saturn Return, inside theHumanDesign Mapportal. If you are already a client,you can dig in here.)

I began taking full ownership of the parts in others that I judged harshly and the ongoing inner work of stepping into a sense of wholeness.

As I have done that work, it has opened me up to the depth of my gate 48. You really can’t go very deep into anything if you aren’t willing to confront the inner critic.

And, I don’t just mean that on the “understanding yourself” level. I also mean it very practically (says my 5th line profile!).

There is no person, no system, no lineage, no leader, no bloodline who is without “fault.”  And when we allow that to hold us back, in our search for perfection, we get stopped dead in our tracks. We write them off before we even have a chance to understand on any kind of real level.

Ra Uru Hu, the original channeler of Human Design, immediately comes to mind. He wasn’t exactly the most stand up guy and did some pretty questionable things; things that today would have had him “canceled” in a heartbeat.

But, the beauty that he brought into this world with Human Design is unmistakable to me. All along the way, in the depths of my studies, I’ve had to remind myself of Debbie Ford’s words:

“The key is to understand that there is nothing we can see or perceive that we are not. If we did not possess a certain quality, we could not recognize it in another.”

I’ve reminded myself that he was a human being, just like me, and that he was perfectly flawed, fallible and whole.

And when I look at it that way, on purpose, it allows me to reclaim my own shadows and move deeper into this system that I love so much.

What a beautiful dance of shadow and light.

### Now it’s your turn to contemplateGate 18

When you stand in the truth that the gifts of gate 18 are always available to you (whether it’s defined in your chart or not)…

What is your relationship with your inner critic? Do you use it to perpetuate harm to yourself? Or do you use it as a gateway into wholeness?

What about the part of you that criticizes and judges others? What would it be like to use every one of those moments as an opportunity for compassion, healing, and wholeness?

What inner or outer judgment can you transform today?

### My Personal Experience with Human Design Gate 19 (Gene Key 19)

Gate 19 isundefinedin my chart. Nonetheless, for most of my life, I was called “too sensitive.” For many years, I even identified as an “empath” and as an “HSP.”

I’ve long shed those identities.

First and foremost, I now understand that I am a late-discovered neurodivergent, AuDHD.

And despite the common misconception about Autism, many autistic people are highly sensitive and struggle with “over empathy” rather than not enough. That is a whole other ball of wax.

But, even just looking at it from a Human Design perspective, I see those themes, as well.

I have an undefined solar plexus and that means that when I have shitty energetic boundaries, I can take on and amplify the emotional wave of thedefinedsolar plexus’ around me.

I used to be hyper-vigilant about the needs of others – especially their emotional needs. I often walked on eggshells because it felt SO terrible to be around people who were feeling uncomfortable emotions.

I would cry at the drop of a hat. And, as I talked about in myhuman design gate 49post, I was quick to cut people out of my life.

I didn’t know that there were other options. That isn’t to say that I tolerate bullshit now. I don’t.

But, understanding my undefined root and solar plexus has been critical in transforming my relationship with the pressures of emotional sensitivity.

(In theHuman Design Mapportal, you will find a guide on the nine centers to help you understand how you might be in the “not self” with your centers.)

My energetic boundaries are much stronger now and I can easily discern which emotions belong to me and which ones don’t. I am also getting pretty good at discerning “incorrect” root pressure.

One of the key tools for developing that kind of discernment is plenty ofPure Aura Time. Pure Aura Time is now one of my top priorities in life.

And between that, and my alchemical skills ( I teach these in themapportal, too), I’ve discovered that there is a massive difference betweenbeing sensitive to other people’s emotional needsandtaking responsibility for them.

In our deeply codependent culture, most of us don’t know the difference. But, once you see the distinction, it will be one of those things you can’t unsee.

When gate 19 is at its highest frequency, being sensitive to the emotional needs of others is actually about understanding other people’s emotional needs but not necessarilydoingsomething about them. It can hold space without taking it on as something to fix.

And, when we are really honest with ourselves about what belongs to us and what doesn’t, our capacity, our boundaries, and our values, it is easy to know when to hold space and when to try to meet their needs.

For me, when my capacity is abundant and it wouldn’t cause me harm to meet their needs, I 100% will. If not, I can just hold space, or in some cases, decline the invitation all together.

Either way, I don’t need to save anyone from themselves. I can be considerate of people’s emotions while holding my boundaries. I can trust that they have what it takes to handle whatever they think and feel.

And, probably most importantly, I can stand firmly in the knowledge that I cannot control how they take it. That is their karma, after all.

If they are one of mymapclients, I can teach them the emotional skills and show them how it’s done. (If you are one of mymapclients, check out the MAP Method for Deconditioning in your map dashboard.)

If it is someone in my personal life, I can tell them the truth and I can sometimes offer guidance about where to get support. And, in the most wild cases, like with random strangers in the grocery store, I can just walk away.

There is nothing I “have to” do for the sake of someone else’s emotional needs. I can be sensitive to their needs and let them have the responsibility.

I will not light myself on fire to keep others warm.

Nowadays, I am much less afraid of other people’s emotions and am much more discerning about who I am in relationship with.

I surround myself with people whowantto understand me, who recognize me, and where mutual respect is abundant.

My peoplewantto take responsibility for their emotions because they know the alchemical magick that comes from owning your authentic feelings; they want to be their own hero.

The people I surround myself with appreciate my candor, my boundaries, and my clarity. Because it means that when I show up for them, it is because it is from an overflow of love, rather than from obligation. It is the only kind of love that sticks.

Today, other people’s emotional needs don’t determine my next steps. Going within and discerning what is true for me does.

And what I know for sure is that I don’t have to choose between having solid boundaries and being sensitive.

It gets to be both, and that is wonderful news.

### My Personal Experience with Human Design Gate 20 (Gene Key 20)

Gate 20 is defined in my conscious Jupiter. I talked briefly about how Gate 20 plays out in Jupiter in my contemplation ofHuman Design Gate 8.

In this contemplation, though, I wanted to reflect on my experience with the 57-20 channel (called the brainwave).

(I cover all of the channels inside theHuman Design Mapportal.)

Gate 57 is defined in the conscious sun ofincarnation crossand the 57-20 has been super interesting to me. It is actually one of the (many) reasons that Human Design clicked with me instantly.

I’ve often had the experience of what I call “pops of clarity.”

Pops of clarity are sort of like sitting at a train crossing before the train arrives. You can hear the train coming, but you have no control over when it will actually show up. It shows up when it does.

With the 57-20, I can intuitively sense information “coming through” and have to wait for clarity.

Then, in a flash, I get a “download” that feels like it needs to be expressed….right now!

This happens a lot with mymapcustomers. They will have a question, and when I first read it, I won’t know what to say. But, I will have a deep sense inside of me that something is “coming through.”

I’ve come to understand that, most often, the mechanics of the person’s chart are “speaking to me” and that I just need to keep listening. Sometimes, that means I ask more questions. Other times, it means I walk away in full trust that an answer is coming.

And, not quite like clockwork 😉, I’ll know exactly what to say and write a thousand words in a couple of minutes flat.

This is just one example of how it plays out. But let me tell you, for most of my life, it was frustrating AF.

I hated the feeling of “knowing” something was “on the way” and having no control over when it showed up.

But after many years ofdeconditioning, that is shifting, and I am deepening my surrender to Divine Timing.

I can see that my mind goes into a tailspin and starts trying to use logic or reason to put language to the inner knowing.

And it literally never works.

When I try to force my intuition out, it gets muddy and never “lands” in a very powerful way.

I have learned that the best thing I can do is….be present.

Be here now.

Every day, I trust that if something needs to be said, I’ll know it when the time is right.

I don’t need to be attached to knowing how, when, where, or why. Or knowing at all.

This shift in thinking allows me to be more present; I actually have space to breathe and just live my life.

Probably even more importantly, my intuition is becoming even stronger every single day. It is sharper and clearer. And when the words do come, they are more powerful than ever.

When I surrender, my words are a healing force in the world; they heal me and the people who encounter me.

It isn’t always easy, but clearly, it is part of my life’s work. I’m literally living for it.If you want to understand more about how your energy works and your life’s purpose,  be sure to get yourHuman Design Map.

### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 21 (Gene Key 21)

Gate 21 is undefined in my chart.

But my husband has it defined in the unconscious sun of hisincarnation cross. And learning that shocked me (gate 51 in my conscious earth!).

I can usually sense the gates in someone’s chart from a mile away. But, in my experience, “controlling” and my husband just did not go together.

In his everyday demeanor, he is incredibly respectful of every living thing he encounters (gate 19!). He has never tried to control me in any way, shape, or form. And he definitely isn’t the stereotypical picture of someone who tries to control the world.

So, it truly baffled me (and made me check my ego!) that he has gate 21 as such a prominent placement.

Similar to my initial feelings about the “salesman” ofgate 26, I was full of negative judgment about what it really means to be a person with gate 21 defined.

As all judgments do, this pointed me to my shadows with gate 21 and the “controlling” parts of myself that I’ve often rejected.

With my Aries rising + my conscious Earth, I’ve often been called domineering, headstrong, and pushy. To be honest, I’ve often chalked this up to being “about them” and not at all about me. 🤣

But, when I look more closely at some of the taboo shadows of gate 21 – control freak, rebel, passive-aggressive – I see myself written all over it.

(I cover the golden and taboo shadows for the gates of your cross in theHuman Design Map.)

I’m human. When my life is out of control, I tend to try to control the world around me. I am not immune to thinking that if other people change, if circumstances were different, or everything is in its “right” place, all would be well with the world.

As I’ve explored and integrated those shadows, I gained access to the full spectrum of energy potential in gate 21. And, because it can only work that way, my husband came into clearer view.

I saw his list of every single thing in the freezer.

I appreciated how he makes impossible things fit in a suitcase and pack the car when we travel.

I noticed how well he manages money and his natural ability to rein in the stuff of life.

And then I had a nice little chuckle because I remembered that his job title is Fixed Asset Manager. He literally gets paid to manage resources.

What?!?!?!

Color me shocked. How did I miss that?

I missed it because I was in judgment of anyone who comes across as controlling. And I was in judgment because I was rejecting those parts of myself.

What I teach people inside theirHuman Design Mapreally is true.

Every gate (line, center, channel, etc.) in the chart holds a spectrum of energy potential. It is our judgments, of ourselves and others, that keep us from accessing all of it.

But when we open our hearts and face the truth of our wholeness, we access our greatest potential.

It is literally all right there in the chart. Even in the gates we think are terrible.

## Affirmations for Human Design Gate 21

Using your Human Design to create affirmations is a powerful way to activate the full potential of your chart. Here are some affirmations for Gate 21:

### The Positive and Negative Sides of Human Design Gate 22

All energy in theHuman Design chart exists on a spectrum of potential.

On the “positive” end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 22 is the energy for offering grace to yourself and others. Gate 22 understands that the full range of emotions, from the heights of ecstatic bliss to the dirtiest darkest pits of shame, are simply human. Because of this understanding, Gate 22 is able to see the whole world as an astounding place of beauty, abundance, and love.

On the “negative” end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 22 is the energy for believing that you do not deserve the beauty, love, or grace in your life. It represses emotions, lives from a place of emotional reactivity and ignores responsibility for it’s emotions through blame, victimization, and finding fault.

IMPORTANT NOTE:It’s crucial to understand that “positive” and “negative” are not intended as moral judgments; they are tools of awareness to support you on your Human Design journey — the journey of radical self-acceptance and bold purpose.

Your Human Design is never to be used as a weapon against yourself or as evidence that you are broken, unlovable, or any other bullshit that blocks your radiance.

If you see yourself on the “negative” side of {gate 22}, please be kind to yourself. This is an opportunity to BE the Love and Grace you so deeply crave (we all so deeply crave!).

When you notice yourself struggling with feeling graceless, “too” emotional or unforgiving, use it as a sign to cultivate curiosity and as a path to a more expanded self-concept.

By adopting this more compassionate way of seeing your “negative” qualities and experiences, you will automatically expand into your chart’s higher and higher potentials. Minus the toxic positivity or gaslighting yourself.

Simply put…

Your ability to embody your chart’s “highest” potential is directly proportional to your ability to unconditionally love your chart’s “lowest” potential. You cannot hate your way to Love and Grace.

This is at the heart of what you will learn in the MAP Method for Deconditioning, my signature course included with your Human Design Map (made just for you) & Portal.Get yours here.

In the meantime, start noticing when you are feeling reactive, awkward or mean but don’t be an asshole to yourself. Treat yourself the way you would a small child – with love, curiosity, and understanding.

### My Personal Experience with Human Design Gate 22 (Gene Key 22)

Oh, Gate 22, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways.

I could write endless books about my experiences and love of Gate 22.

The energy of Grace has been such a significant part of my life.

Gate 22 is undefined in my chart, but my husband has the entire 12-22 channel.

(I dive deeply into all 36 channels inside theHuman Design Map portal.)

From a Gene Keys perspective, my husband’s attraction sphere is gate 22, and I am confident that our meeting wasFierce Gracein action.

Then I laid my eyes on him for the first time; I knew that our rivers were meeting for a reason.

We had some beautiful mirror work to do together.

I was raised in a religious culture that perpetuated really toxic ideas about Grace. Things like Grace, Mercy, and God’s Love were used as weapons to control others and ensure that “the top” stayed at the top.

I spent many years rebelling against any idea that even came close to the “Grace” of my upbringing.

But that all changed shortly after meeting my husband.

My husband isn’t a “spiritual” kind of guy. At the beginning of our relationship, I asked him what he thinks about God, and he literally said, “I don’t.”

But he embodies Grace on a level that I can’t even describe.

Even in my absolutely “ugliest” moments, there is never a single doubt of his unconditional love.

He doesn’t use my “negative” states against me or as tools for manipulation.

He is deeply present with all of me – in my shadow and in my light.

I can honestly say that I’d never experienced that with a human being before him.

He opened me up to heal the wounds of toxic religion and energetically showed me how to receive the Fiercest Grace of all – the Grace of the Divine.

Shortly after we were married, I went to a Baron Baptiste yoga workshop in Dallas, Texas. I was in yoga teacher training, and he was all the rage in the vinyasa yoga scene.

So much so that I paid hundreds of dollars and flew over 1000 miles to practice yoga with himfor four hours.

And it was an experience I will never forget.

There were hundreds of people, and we were mat to mat. Our sweat literally dripped on one another as we pushed through the incredible limits of our minds.

He guided us through 3.5 hours of vinyasa, ending with a very long savasana.

Krishna Das was blaring on the speakers.

“My foolish heart

Why do you weep?

You throw yourself away again

Now you cry yourself to sleep.

Cry yourself to sleep…

My foolish heart

When will you learn?

You are the eyes of the world

And there’s nowhere else to turn.

Nowhere else to turn…”

Krishna Das, My Foolish Heart, Heart as Wide as the World

There I was, my body completely vulnerable, sweat drying into a gritty mess on my skin, and deep, snotty sobs pouring out of me. Surrounded by hundreds of strangers.

There was no fear of judgment. There was no worry about what others were thinking of me. No part of me believed that I shouldn’t be sobbing like that.

But more importantly, there was this deep knowing that all of me was welcome.

My body knew that I am loved without condition.

No hoops. No hierarchies. No lovable and unlovable.

It was Grace. It is all Grace.

I’ve had endless experiences of Grace since then.

And, from this open place, I can even see the slivers of Grace in my early, though quite traumatic, childhood and early adulthood.

But this was the moment that made me aware that Grace is everywhere.

As I said, it is a moment I will never forget.

And it is that moment that I want to channel in everything I do.

Writing this post. Supporting my clients inside theHuman Design Map portal. Going to the grocery store.

Fierce Grace in action.

On the “positive” end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 23 is the energy for using your voice to communicate radical ideas and to become recognized for your ability to initiate transformation with your words alone.With gate 23 defined, you are likely to be known for getting to the point, simplifying complex ideas, and not wasting precious time or energy by babbling on about things that do not serve the end goal.

On the “negative” end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 23 is the energy of holding back out of fear that you are too weird, worrying that people don’t care what you have to say because you are “too out there.” When feeling unrecognized, you might even tend to talk “at” people who aren’t ready to listeninstead of trusting that there are people who want to hear what you have to say.

### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 23 (Gene Key 23)

Gate 23 is undefined in my chart, but it is a pretty significant because it is one of the gates that will bridge my small split.

Withgate 62,gate 43, andgate 56hanging, I have a small split between my ajna and throat.

So, Gate 23 is one of the gates that would bridge that split.

One of the common experiences with hanging gates, especially when they hang in a significant spot in the chart like mine, is that we can experience feelings of inadequacy in the undefined gate.

As I always say, where we are defined, we often feel like we are “too much,” and where we are undefined, we can feel like we are “not enough.” And gates that bridge splits are like fuel on that fire.

(I discuss the effect of hanging gates, splits, and channels more inside theHuman Design Map & Portal.)

That “not enough” voice was loud and clear when I first wrote my personal contemplation of Gate 23.

That was in 2022, and I was writing the gates articles on a schedule that put me a little ahead of when the sun would transit each ofthe 64 Human Design Gates.

One of the themes that began to unfold was that my life would start to reflect the gate somehow and layers of conditioning were peeling away.

And, true to form, that happened with Gate 23, but in a really profound way. With the gates I’d written before, my life was showing me. But in this case, it was the actual process of writing.

As I stared at the screen before me, I racked my brain for something profound to say. I really wanted to blow your mind with some sort of radical insight.

I started scanning for quantum leaps.What have I said to someone that triggered a quantum leap for them? What had someone said to me that completely blew my mind? What quantumn leaps was I seeing in the world around me?

Then, I thought about the people with gate 23 that I’ve guided. I thought about one of my coaches with Gate 23 defined. I thought about friends or people I follow online.

I even started mentally making a list of “profound” statements I could share.

And, like a lightning bolt, I saw clearly what my conditioned mind was doing.

My mind was trying to compensate for my perceived inadequacy. It was telling me a story that, because this was gate 23 it must be profound and earth-shattering. I had convinced myself that if it didn’t trigger a quantum leap for whoever read it, it was a worthless piece of trash.

Good times. And so hilarious to me now.  How cute of my brain.

As I saw what was happening, I was able to surrender.

Gate 23 doesn’t “make” quantum leaps happen by “trying.” It happens spontaneously, through Divine Timing. And Divine Timing rarely matches our stories about timing.

When we look at the mechanics of the chart, we can see that from the head to the ajna, we can’t force the ajna to produce insight – we just have to sit with the questions and allow insight to arrive.

And from the ajna to the throat, we can’t force the “right” words to come out or make others receive our words. All of that is left to the mystery of synchronicity.

And what Gate 23 shows us is that a captive audience is part of the synchronicity. Like allprojected energy, it is dependent on the receptivity of the people listening.

So, even if I say the most brilliant shit ever and you aren’t receptive to it, it will not land as a quantum leap. And I can say the most mundane shit ever but it be the exact thing you needed to hear to catapult into your next iteration.

It is like a square peg, round hole scenario.

Forcing it won’t work. Because it does not work that way.

I am grateful for what Gate 23 showed me that day. I am more aware of when I am trying to conjure profound words, instead of just letting them flow. I don’t need to carry the weight of that anymore.

By design, I will just keep attuning to my Gate 43 and let the mystery of Grace take care of the rest.

Pretty profound, no?

### The Positive and Negative Sides of Human Design Gate 24

All energy in theHuman Design chart exists on a spectrum of potential.

On the “positive” end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 24 is the energy for wise rationalization and being in silence when needed. Gate 24 believes that silence really is golden and that pausing is sacred. It is able to bring through inspiration and transformation by mastering the subtle pause between giving and receiving.

On the “negative” end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 24 is the energy for avoiding silence with buffering or filling it with unnecessary noise.  It beats itself up or shames itself for needing to revisit ideas, over and over again, before they “click”. And struggling to find the balance between giving and receiving.

You’ll learn about the surprising (but most effective) way to raise your energy frequency in theHuman Design Map + Portal.

### My Personal Experience with Human Design Gate 24 (Gene Key 24)

The Channel of Awareness (61-24) is defined inmy human design chart, giving me a definedhead centerandajna center.Gate 61—mystery, inner truth, and divine knowing—is in my unconscious Earth and Gate 24 in my unconscious South Node.

When I first learned aboutGate 61, it was an immediate moment of clarity. I got it. Yes, absolutely—I’m a mystic and always have been. It took me a while to accept my mystic path, but I always knew it.

Gate 24, though, wasn’t an instant click (irony?). It’s often called the gate the addict, which I totally resonated with. I’ve struggled with all sorts of addiction in my life —drugs, alcohol, sex with strangers, food—the thing about silence wasn’t really clear, though.

It took years of lived experience—sobriety, self-inquiry, and prioritizingpure aura time—before I truly understood that silence isn’t just the absence of noise.

When the world around us is quiet, our thoughts get LOUD. And it can be uncomfortable AF.

In that discomfort, the voice of rationalization (addiction) rises up, as if its a savior on a white horse.

That became crystal clear to me one day while driving in silence (on of my favorite pure aura time practices). No music, no podcasts, no audiobooks.

Just me and my mind.

Suddenly, with pristine clarity, I heard the voice of addiction.

I was rationalizing making a harmful choice. Thoughts that, maybe even the day before, would have driven me straight into old patterns. They weren’t dramatic thoughts; they actually sounded quite reasonable:

- A little won’t hurt.

- Just make it easy on yourself.

- This time will be different; I can handle it.

But reason is flawed and true mysticism requires surrendering it.

And in that moment, I realized that my addictive voice sounded nothing like I’d assumed. It didn’t feel chaotic, out of control, or irrational. Instead, it was a calm, convincing voice that seemed so true.

But it wasn’t the truth; it was justifying one of the things that disconnects me from my inner truth. It was the snake in the Garden of Eden.

Had I been listening to a podcast, or book, or even my belovedTrevor Hall, I might not have even heard it. I would have been well on my way to the land of disconnection.

In the silence, though, Iheardthe loop.

And because I heard it, I had power over it. I did not have to believe it (aka act on it as if it was the Truth).

Instead, I just kept driving to my intended destination.

(Inside the​Human Design Map​, I guide you through the patterns in your chart that show up just like this—because when you can witness the story while it’s happening, you finally get to choose something different.)

That day, Gate 24 clicked for me in a whole new way. And my path with addiction changed.

Gate 24 was no longer just the “gate of the addict.” It was the voice of the mind trying to escape discomfort. It was the justifier. The sweet-talker. The one that makes running away from my inner world look like wisdom.

And more than anything, it was a reflection of how hard it can be tojust bewith ourselves when everything is quiet. To look inside and meet our maker. To receive the blessings of inner truth.

When we believe every thought, silence can feel like torture. When we’ve built our lives around productivity, pleasure, or people-pleasing, silence can feel like failure. When we don’t have the skills to be with ourselves, it can feel like the only thing left to do is drown our sorrows.

Some of us escape with substances. Others through work, scrolling, sex, overthinking, or staying busy all the time. But no matter the vice, the problem is the same: trying to avoid the discomfort that arises when we slow down enough to witness ourselves honestly.

We’re not taught how to do that. There’s no “Thought Loops 101” in school. No one teaches us how to sit in the gap between a thought and a choice.

But Gate 24 shows us that space. And that’s where our power returns.

(If you’re learning how to discern the difference between your truth and your mental conditioning, your chart will show you exactly where to look. That’s what I teach in the​Human Design Map & Portal​.)

Obviously, I can’t say with certainty that I’ll never revisit old behaviors. The loop still runs sometimes. The temptation to escape still shows up.

But I’m onto myself now.

You can’t un-hear these thoughts once you recognize them for what they are. Addiction. Avoidance. Rationalization.

But when you make the space to be with yourself, in the silence, you can’t unsee your power, either.

And it is that remembering that is the magick.

That’s why I created the​Human Design Map​—not as a rulebook or magic pill, but as a mirror. A compassionate tool for helping you recognize the patterns, the loops, and the moments where you finally have the choice to return to yourself.

### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 25 (Gene Key 25)

Gate 25 is undefined in my chart. Butgate 51, which is the other side of the channel of initiation with gate 25, is defined in my conscious earth.

Our conscious earth is the energy that keeps us grounded and gives us the foundation necessary to surrender to our soul’s purpose (the conscious sun).

My conscious sun is in gate 57, meaning my soul’s purpose is to prioritize intuitive clarity above all else.

And the foundation I need in place to do that is the attitude of awakening that comes from the highest frequency of gate 51.

(I deep dive into your conscious sun + earth + all 36 channels + more in theHuman Design Map.)

Gate 51 is the gate of shock. And that shock can make us bitter, resentful, and unconscious in our lives.

On the other hand, shock can facilitate opening up to higher planes of consciousness and spiritual awareness.

But it isn’t the shock itself that does that.

What cracks our heart wide open is the revelation that Unconditional Love is the very fabric of the Universe.

So many of us have been conditioned to believe that Love is conditional. We have been taught that we have to jump through hoops to be lovable, worthy, and whole.

In that conditioning, we forget that we are the Divine Incarnate. We let it slip from our awareness that we are Love in action. We turn our back on the Grace, Compassion, Forgiveness, and Acceptance that is available to us in every moment.

Even a tiny glimpse of those things can be shocking when we are trapped in the illusion of being separated from the Divine.

But in those glimpses, we remember.

We call back the seeds of Truth and we reorient ourselves to the never ending practice of Unconditional Love. For ourselves, for others, for the things that happen, for the state of the world.

And it isn’t exactly easy. If it were easy, everyone would do it, right?

But what I know for sure is that it’s worth it. The ripple effect is worth it. The work of not turning against ourselves, and others, is worth it.

If you want a guide as you practice Unconditional Love, invite me in theHuman Design Map.

## The Positive and Negative Sides of Human Design Gate 26

All energy in theHuman Design chart exists on a spectrum of potential.

On one end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 26 is the energy for being a champion for dreams that come true. Because the 26 trusts in the abundance of life, it is empowered to sell a brighter future to their tribewith integrity.

On the other end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 26 is the energy to manipulate or control others for its own gain.

You’ll learn about the surprising (but most effective) way to raise your energy frequency in theHuman Design Map + Portal.

In the meantime, start noticing when you are feeling fear driven, selfish or shameful but don’t be an asshole to yourself. Treat yourself the way you would a small child – with love, curiosity, and understanding.

## My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 26 (Gene Key 26)

Gate 26 isundefinedin my chart but I do havehuman design gate 44hanging in my (heavily) definedhuman design spleen center.

And when I was first contemplating gate 26 in my own life, I immediately thought of a sleazy used car salesman. I also noticed that a lot of the traditional Human Design information seemed only to reiterate that “negative” image.

The sleazy car salesperson will do and sayanythingto get the sale. They follow you around the lot and try to convince you that a Pinto is a Rolls Royce.

That was definitely the original image that was building in my mind and I noticed incredible amounts of resistance building up inside of me. Which, in so many cases, is a signal that there is ashadowready to be transformed into valuable purpose.

So, in noticing the resistance, I reflected on what it has been like learning sales and marketing as a business owner and creator of theHuman Design Map.

Though I have only been selling themapsince 2020, I have been in business since 2009. And true to my Midheaven being inhuman design gate 54, I quickly realized that sales and marketing would be part of my life almost every single day.

Before I was in business, I deeply believed that “being spiritual” and making money were opposed to one another. I was raised in a toxic religion and under the weight of patriarchal systems of oppression.

In those first years in business, something became crystal clear, though.

Without sales and marketing, I don’t make money. And if I don’t make money, I can’t pay my mortgage, buy groceries, or stock my bookshelves. 🙂

As I began to awaken to material success being a valid spiritual path (54), I realized that I’d need to overcome my negative connotations with sales and develop it as a skill that I am confident in.

I’ve come a long way with it, for sure, and by no means did I think I was done with my growth in this area. It seems I am always learning from the mistakes of the past (44) and figuring out what really works for me and myprojector aura.

But, even with well over a decade of that journey under my belt, I wasn’t expecting that contemplating gate 26 would be so healing for me.

And, whether sales are a regular part of your life or not, I think that what I learned could be an important lesson for you, too.

By now, it is probably clear AF that my relationship with the Divine is important to me.Human Design Gate 61in my unconscious earth means that I am a mystic. I am spiritually grounded and connected by having direct experience of the Divine and finding the golden thread among all paths to “God.”

And I have grown a lot from my religious upbringing.

I never really resonated with the churches I was raised in, and I abandoned those beliefs in my late teens.

By my early twenties, I had made my way into a life of drugs, alcohol, and sex with strangers.

That whole decade is basically a blur until my brother died shortly after my 28th birthday (aka first Saturn Return). It was the first of many spiritual awakenings that led me to where I am today (which honestly cannot easily be defined with words).

(If you are one of mymapclients, be sure to check out the quick and dirty guide on Planetary Seasons in themapportal.)

A couple years after I came out of my Saturn Return, I was introduced toRichard Rohrand one of his most popular books,Falling Upward.

The book’s premise is that in the first spiritual phase of our lives, we rely on other people to tell us who God is and tell us what to do to get into God’s Good Graces.

And, in the second spiritual phase of our lives, we begin to open up to our own understanding of God. It becomes a personal relationship instead of a dictated one.

In the book, he offers his personal insights about the possibilities of what that could be.

But, more importantly than that, he talks about the difference betweencollapsing our definition of Godorexpanding it.

He posits that when we face challenges in our lives, we tend to make our definition of God smaller. And that the very impulse to “collapse” God is an invitation to expand your definition of God.

In other words, if your definition of God isn’t big enough to hold whatever you are going through, it means you need to make your definition of God bigger.

This completely blew my mind. I can vividly remember storming out of my parent’s house at the age of 18, telling them that I didn’t believe in God.

I had certainly made my definition of God smaller. I could not reconcile my lived experience with that old definition of God.

So, when I read that book, I made a promise to myself that I was willing to reckon with my definition of God and the beliefs about the world that I hold dear. And that if my beliefs couldn’t reconcile out, I’d make God even bigger.

And this brings me back to Human Design Gate 26.

I have long held the belief that everyshadowis simply unconscious energy “leaking out sideways.”All energy lives on a spectrumand, therefore, there is always a conscious (aka light) side.

When we harness our energy with conscious intent, we make magick. It is just a matter of looking at the shadows through a fresh, non-dualistic, non-judgmental lens.

But gate 26. UGH. I was hearing all the sales coaches in my head telling me that “sales are service.” I was trying to see the gifts, the value, the innate lovability. But the sleazy car salesman just kept appearing in my mind.

I felt myselfcollapsing. Like, this tiny little gate in thewill centerwould be the death of my faith inshadow work. LOL.

And then, it hit me.

Go bigger.

Go bigger than the judgment. Go bigger than the car lot. Go bigger than uncomfortable sales conversations.

Go bigger.

I looked at it in a new light and asked myself what it would look like if I made the definition of the 26 bigger than a mere sleazy car salesman? What would it look like to believe that the natural salesperson inside every human soul is full of light? What if I loved the 26 as much as I love the22? Or the57? Or the61?

What if I opened my mind to the possibility of EVERY quality having potential for beauty, awe, and wonder? And what if I let myself love all of the parts that make up that potential?

The result of that question was a deeper understanding of thespectrumof the 26.

Yes, sales are service when they serve everyone involved. And yes, integrity is the most essential value of the 26. And yes, the 26 does help us move into more expanded possibilities in our lives by selling us the things that can take us there.

But at the heart of the 26 is TRUST in the abundance of the Universe.

In that knowing, I could see myself in the sleazy car salesman. I could see myself trying to control and manipulate others. I could see myself convincing myself that my intentions are pure even when they aren’t.

And with that, my heart exploded with compassion. For me. For the sleazy car salesman. And for everyone who has been in theshadowsof the 26 because they weren’t trusting in the abundance of life.

This applies to so many areas of our lives. Not just sales, marketing, and business.

But, relationships, food, money, love, worthiness. Everything.

What would it look like to trust in the abundance of life?

The answer is in the confidence of the fully conscious 26.

## Now it’s your turn to contemplate Human Design Gate 26

When you stand in the Truth that you are worthy of the abundance of life…

Where have you given into the fears of lack and scarcity? And in what ways has that led you to control or manipulate the people around you?

Can you have compassion for yourself?

In what ways can you open up to the abundance of life?

And what does trusting in that abundance look like? How does it change conversations? How does it change your relationship with food, your body, money? How does it change your view of worthiness? And lovability?

What do you need to sell yourself on so that you can finally lean into that trust?

I hope that these questions open you up to all that is available to you. The compassion. The trust. The abundance.

It’s all right there waiting for you. You need to sell yourself on it.

### The Positive and Negative Sides of Human Design Gate 27

All energy in theHuman Design chart exists on a spectrum of potential.

Gate 27 takes responsibility for its values, needs, beliefs, thoughts, feelings, and actions to ensure healthy relationships. And from this place, has immense energy for caring for others – especially sick, young, or in need.

On the “negative” end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 27 is the energy for taking incorrect responsibility for other people’s needs. It self-sacrifices and cares for others in an attempt to prove that it is worthy of safety, love belonging , and support.

### My Personal Experience with Human Design Gate 27 (Gene Key 27)

Gate 27 is defined in my conscious South Node.

The gates in our nodes tell the two-part story of how our soul grows into the realization of our deeper purpose—theincarnation cross.

At first, our purpose can feel distant—quiet, hidden, or even non-existent. But as we grow through the nodal gates—layer by layer—we begin to see that our purpose is already alive and well. It was simply waiting for us to witness it and receive its bounty.

The gate in the South Node marks the first major growth arc toward embodied purpose. It’s the origin story—the area of development that builds the foundation for the second phase, which begins at the Uranus Opposition.

That’s when we begin shifting into the second major growth arc, led by the North Node. As we grow through that gate, we begin to experience the undying presence of our purpose—how everything that came before was preparing us to truly receive the beauty and wisdom of our soul’s purpose.(Inside theHuman Design Map & Portal, you’ll find a guide on transits and planetary seasons like the Uranus Opposition—plus tools and support to help you navigate the path.)

My incarnation cross is the Left Angle Cross of the Clarion 2—a path of intuitive clarity (57), awakening (51), giving voice to truths that cut through illusion (62), and mysticism (61).

But I didn’t always see that unfolding. I saw myself as too much—too woo-woo, too deep, too intense. I thought I needed to tone it all down just to fit in. And I felt purposeless so much of the time.

As I got older and started leaning into the arc of my Gate 27 South Node, I began to prioritize my own care. I started choosing my well-being over people-pleasing—and everything began to shift.

Before that, my life was spent caught in the karmic tension between caring for others and constantly feeling drained. I put my needs at the very end of the line.

I drowned them in food, alcohol, drugs, and sex with strangers. I knew how to “show up” for other people, but I abandoned myself constantly. And when I got sober and quit binge eating, I had to face how little I actually knew about what I needed.

Taking away the addictions left gaping holes I didn’t know how to fill. It was like a crash course in true and deep self-care.

In the beginning of that journey, I didn’t have astrology orHuman Designto help me navigate the path. I relied on surface-level things like Pinterest quotes and cliché Cosmo listicles. And honestly? Some of those things did help.

But the real change began when I was able to take those surface-level tips and alchemize them into real, energetic insight.

That’s where astrology, energy healing, andHuman Designcame in. They helped me see my needs more clearly—beyond coping mechanisms and towardenergetic alignment.

For example, with my5/2 profile, I realized how important it is for my body to get its alone time. I thrive when my days are open and full of space—space to be in natural rhythm, to follow what feels alive, to rest when I need to. And my mind needs to sort through the mess of conventional wisdom and come up with heretical solutions.

(YourHuman Design profileholds so many clues about what you need and how you deliver your gifts. If you’re still figuring yours out, I break it down in depth in theHuman Design Map & Portal.)

That’s just one of many examples. But at the end of the day, when I treat those things as essential care instead of afterthoughts, I feel more connected to myself, my gifts, and my purpose.

Instead of waking up every day and dreading it, I love serving my clients in theMap Portal. My personal relationships feel mutual and grounded. I no longer feel like I have to set myself on fire to keep everyone else warm.

Putting those foundational pieces in place has given me the capacity to lean into the next arc—Gate 28, my North Node. When I’m well-nourished and cared for, I’m more willing to take risks, explore the dark places, and shape the meaning of my life with purpose.

And in turn, that opens up even more trust in my intuition, radical faith in life, potent words, and spiritual exploration.

More importantly, I can see that purpose unfolding. I don’t need to “find my purpose” or look for it in elusive places. It is alive and well. I can feel it in my bones. And I know it in every cell of my being.

Of course, I’m still learning. I’m still softening. I’m still showing up when it gets hard.

And even though it’s messy sometimes, I know—without a shadow of a doubt—that none of that beauty can unfold if I’m abandoning myself.

Onward and upward.

If you’re stuck in patterns of over-giving or struggling to meet your own needs, your chart holds themapfor coming back home to yourself. Whether or not you have Gate 27 defined, honoring the full picture of your energy is the key to creating beauty and purpose in a way you experience in your bones.

### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 28 (Gene Key 28)

Gate 28 is defined in my chart 4 times:

- Conscious North Node in 28.2

- Conscious Mars 28.1

- Conscious Uranus 28.5

- Unconscious Uranus 28.2.

In astrology, anytime we have three or more planets in the same sign, it is known as a stellium, which is a fancy word for super important. The energy of the stellium will be like a golden thread that runs through your whole life, creating ripple effects in the rest of your chart.

And, well, with Gate 28 being all about our relationship to death, this one belongs in the “you can’t make this shit up” category.

Death met me early in life.

It was a Wednesday and my second grade teacher pulled me to the side to tell me that my great grandfather had died.

A couple of years later, a grandmother. A popular girl died in a tragic accident during high school. Two close friends died by suicide shortly after.

During my first Saturn return, one of my brothers died in a car accident at age 25, followed quickly by an aunt and my grandfather.

Then, in 2020, my other brother died of a drug overdose at 36, and my grandmother, less than two months later.

The reminder that life is fragile, dotting my life like sprinkles on a cupcake. I learned fast and early that life can change in an instant and in ways you never imagined possible.

We are living AND we are dying. At the same time.

And despite our rugged attempts at trying, we can’t actually run from the reality of nature. The dance between life and death is the way that it is.

For the first part of my life, death was difficult for me to process. Like so many in the West, I was ill equipped and poorly supported in grief and loss.

The world often seemed cruel – like a sick karmic joke. And I found escape in drugs, binge drinking, and sex with strangers. I fell into dark holes of believing that life had no meaning and that I had no purpose except to suffer.

My relationship with death started to shift after my first brother died, though.

In all honesty, I can’t say that I processed his death in a healthy way. But, it did mark a pivotal moment of awakening for me.

As the weeks turned into months, Saturn’s message was clear:

I could not continue the path I was on. I had to change. There were no if’s, and’s, or but’s about it.

The first shift in my awareness was that we have a choice in how we handle grief. We can use it as fuel for expanding our consciousness or we can use it to collapse in the face of life.

Within a few years, I was well on my path with shadow integration work. I had heard about it in my very first training as a coach and was hooked instantly.

Human Design, or even astrology, were not on my radar yet. But, I was consciously walking away from the toxic religious conditioning of my childhood. And I was starting to be recognized for my natural projector gifts as a guide and truth teller.

To my surprise, shadow work seemed like a language that my body already knew how to speak. As I worked with clients, going into the depths of someone’s shame and fear was like a normal day at the office.

I was not afraid of it. I held space for the kind of darkness that most people don’t even know exist. And, through the mystery of Grace, people seemed to be “healed” in my presence.

And, by healed, I mean they were able to see themselves clearly – as a fractal of the Divine – in the Great Mirror of life. My words, shaking them awake and forcing them to surrender under the weight of their Divinity.

And while it looks different and my role isn’t the same, now, I still hold space for that kind of healing today inside theHuman Design Mapportal.

It’s one of the reasons I love Human Design so much – it is like a fast track to the shadows that are in desperate need of our attention, acceptance, and unshakeable love.

And when we meet ourselves there, eyes wide open, miracles happen.

Our consciousness expands and we become capable of holding a broader spectrum of frequencies in our lives. The highs become higher and the lows become lower, and none of it is better or worse. We embrace ourwholeness.

(You’ll learn “how” inside theHuman Design Mapportal.)

It has only been recently that I’ve made the connection between all of thatanddeath.

Richard Rudd, of theGene Keys, talks about the connection between purpose, shadow, and death all the time.  And it was his work, on Gate 28 (Gene Key 28), that opened me up to the connection to begin with.

But it wasn’t until my second brother died, in 2020, that it all started to click.

As weird as it sounds, his death was a profoundly healing experience around purpose and death for me. I write about it in my post onGate 15, which was his conscious sun.

One of the things that became clear was that it is only the ego that dies.

His soul continues to live and breathe. He is with me. I can hear him laugh.

His wild hearted essence still permeates my life. His purpose is alive and well. Minus the attachment.

And when we are transforming our shadows into light, when we are facing the deepest darkest parts of ourselves, we are letting go of attachments.

(You’ll learn how all that works – in the context of your Human Design – inside theHuman Design Mapportal.)

Our ego – the parts of ourselves that are attached to being seen as good, worthy, enough – dies. The strings of attachment turning to ash in the fires of Fierce Grace.

We understand, however briefly, that we are whole. We let go of the shame. We become humbled by the power of unconditional love.

And then, we do it again and again. Meeting ourselves there.

Dying. Dying. Dying again.

I have often joked that I’ve lived many lifetimes in this one life. Or that past me would be dead or in jail by now.

The transformations I’ve gone through are nothing short of wild AF. Like, how in the world did I go from being a strung out addict to being a guide to thousands inside theHuman Design Mapportal?

I understand now that it is because of all of the attachments I’ve let go of.

In the words of Carl Jung, I would rather be whole than good. Trying to be good was killing me. And letting go seemed like the only choice to make.

That isn’t to say that it is easy or that I always navigate it with Grace. It gets messy AF and I have moments I’m not proud of.

But, I do take comfort in the thought that only the ego dies. And that I’ve done that a million times already.

### The Positive and Negative Sides of Human Design Gate 29

All energy in theHuman Design chart exists on a spectrum of potential.

On the “positive” end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 29 is the energy for being faithful and devoted to the things that matter. To Gate 29, commitment, faith, and devotion are magical medicine when they come from the heart and from what truly lights you up. But poison when they come from obligation, fear, or as an attempt to prove your worthiness. In this knowing, it has the energy to be devoted from a place of love and being lit up.

On the “negative” end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 29 is the energy for feeling burned out or overcommitted. If it gets trapped in cycles of trying to prove its worthiness and stays devoted to things that don’t really matter, it can quickly become depleted and frustrated.

You’ll learn about the surprising (but most effective) way to raise your energy frequency in theHuman Design Map + Portal.

### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 29 (Gene Key 29)

One of the things I am often talking to Generators and Manifesting Generators, both insidethe mapportal and otherwise, is that when the sacral says YES to something, it is an indicator of long term commitment, not just the present moment.

Some of them have been disillusioned by the promises of “following their strategy and authority.” When they say YES to something they love or that “lights them up”, they are surprised when challenges crop up, some parts feel really hard, or, heaven forbid, when it simply doesn’t work out.

Maybe they felt completely lit up by a job opportunity and they didn’t get hired. Or they responded to a need in the marketplace with their services and no one purchased. Or they moved into their dream home and it ended up being a nightmare.

They often think they must not have been really listening to their authority and begin questioning themselves. Or, they become upset with the system because of its broken promises.

The problem here is two fold.

For one, the marketing within the Human Design space often makes it look like “following your strategy and authority” will lead you to a life of pure bliss and mattresses full of money.

And it just doesn’t work that way.

Human Design does not give us a free pass from the real, lived Human experience. To be a human means a life that is a mix of a broad spectrum of emotions, experiences, and circumstances. Some parts will be amazing AF and other parts will just plain suck.

And things aren’t going right or wrong, either way. Life just is what it is.

Human Design is a beautiful doorway into self-discovery. And in some cases, will even feel like a huge permission slip tofinallybe authentic.

But it won’t solve the challenges of life.

Which leads me to the second part of the problem.

A sacral YES isn’t a promise of bliss. That isn’t what the sacral does – at all.

The sacral sustains life.

Within the sacral, we see the energy for making babies, caring for others, and seeing projects through. None of which will be a cake walk 24/7.

When the sacral says yes, it is saying:

I have the energy to sustain raising a child, including changing shitty diapers.

This project is going to be epic and I have what it takes to get it done, no matter what challenges crop up along the way.

I’m going to grow this garden; I will water it, feed it, deal with the pests, and harvest the fruits of my labor.

That is what the sacralloves to do. Seeing it through is what lights up a sacral like the most stunning sunrise you’ve ever seen. Finding your way through the balance of the baby smiles and shitty diapers is the recipe for satisfaction.

Which brings me back to gate 29.

When I first wrote the contemplation for the 29, I’d had a bit of an epiphany that thedevotionof the 29 was different thancommitment.

I realize now, though, that the words I used didn’t do a great job of saying what I was seeing. What I was attempting to do was give voice to the trying to the difference between the sacral and the will, particularly in the lower frequencies.

Both my sacral and will center are undefined. And teasing apart the differences is something that has been a big part of my wisdom journey.

I see it more clearly now.

In the highest frequency, the 29 isdevoted(aka committed) to the callings of the higher heart (what I call the G center). It listens for the voice of the magnetic monopole (aka soul) and follows it relentlessly by surrendering its outdated egoic attachments.

In the highest frequency, the will center summons willpower to break through the limits of the ego. It doesn’t use willpower to force “incorrect” shit to happen. It serves (40), competes (51), sells (26), and takes charge (21) to expand its consciousness of what it means to be a human with a functioning ego.

But in the lower frequencies, the sacral will stick with it because they think they should, not because they love it and find it truly satisfying. And the will uses willpower to stay stuck inside an egoic box.

And what I often see is Gens and Mani Gens using low frequency willpower to fuel the commitments that just don’t fit anymore. The warm soft glow of the lit up sacral has long burned out. So, they start forcing themselves just to stay in the outdated identity.

Like someone who stays in a shitty marriage because they don’t know who they are without their spouse. They are so attached to the identity of being married that they start using willpower to show up in the marriage.

This, of course, often happens with non-sacral types as well. And the deconditioning we do with Human Design really helps us to explore all the ways we are forcing energy rather than flowing with it.

And what the 29 shows up, so beautifully, is that sticking with something is actually quite satisfying, when it is the higher heart calling the shots, rather than society, culture, and corrupt tribal attachments.

When we are coming from our own inner wisdom – the higher heart – the energy will be there. And surrendering to that truth is the magic.

### The Positive and Negative Sides of Human Design Gate 30

All energy in theHuman Design chart exists on a spectrum of potential.

On the “positive” end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 30 is the energy for reveling in the intensity of desire and emotion. Gate 30 has an innate knowing that a full spectrum of intense feelings are a natural part of the human experience. From this place, it is able to draw in, feel, and process the depths of desire through a lens of human emotion.

On the “negative” end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 30 is the energy for destructive sensation and/or intensity seeking. Without surrendering to the full spectrum of emotion, Gate 30 can lose it’s faith in life and the connection to desire.

You’ll learn about the surprising (but most effective) way to raise your energy frequency in theHuman Design Map + Portal.

In the meantime, start noticing when you are feeling insatiable, depraved or solicitous but don’t be an asshole to yourself. Treat yourself the way you would a small child – with love, curiosity, and understanding.

### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 30 (Gene Key 30)

At this point, I have surrendered to my love affair with theHuman Design gates(andthe lines:D).

The gates capture the essence of the archetypal journey of being human and give us such clear and precise language to express our experiences.

By understanding thefull spectrumof potential in the gates, they can alchemize judgment into compassion and shame into wholeness. They show us that there isn’t just one side of the story and that how we work with any given energy determines our overall vibration.

When we work skillfully with the energy of any gate in the chart, it vibrates at a higher frequency than when we are completely unconscious of our expression of it.

(I’ll do a deep dive on the full spectrum of potential for all the gates in yourincarnation crossin yourHuman Design Map.)

Gate 30 is the one that demonstrated this in a way that I will never forget.

Gate 30 and mysolar plexusareundefined, so part of my higher purpose is gathering wisdom about emotional energy.

And gather wisdom, I have. 😂

Like many others in my generation (and the generations before me), I was taught to be afraid and ashamed of my emotions. I was conditioned to believe that my emotions were a problem (even the so-called positive ones) and that I was terrible and wrong for expressing them.

Plus, I was raised in an environment where certain emotions meant literal danger, and I became hypervigilant in being an emotional caretaker to keep myself safe.

To soothe my emotions, I began binge eating at the age of 8, and that turned to exercise bulimia in my early teens. That eventually turned into drugs and alcohol in my early adult years.

During my first Saturn Return, one of my brothers died in a car accident. As profound loss and significant astrological milestones tend to do, this was a major turning point in my life.

Within a few years, I had completely turned my life around. I got into therapy and started to learn about my emotions.

As time progressed, I started to see that all of the emotions moving through me weren’t my own. I was often taking on the emotions of others and made myself responsible for resolving them. Food, exercise, drugs, and alcohol were my ways of dealing with the truth – that shit was never mine to hold.

Because that is the thing about other people’s emotions – no matter how open, undefined, or wise we are – we can’t do other people’s emotional work for them.

With that awareness, I started to embody clearer boundaries. I prioritizedspending lots of time in my own pure auraand developed discernment about which emotions belonged to me and which ones didn’tdidn’t.

I did a metric fuck ton of shadow integration work around the way I found so-called worthiness in being other people’s emotional dumping ground and how hard it often felt to let go of shit that wasn’t mine.

The more clarity I got and integrated I became, something magickal happened.

I started to notice that when emotions were actually mine to deal with and when I revered them enough to be present with them, they weren’t so scary. I realized that they hold potent wisdom and that allowing them is how you access that wisdom.

(I’ll teach you how inside theHuman Design Mapportal (no matter your solar plexus definition.)

And true to the highest frequency of gate 30, I found that I could even experience pleasure in so-called negative emotions.

The real turning point was when I had an orgasm while processing shame.

Yes, you read that correctly. Feeling shame gave me an orgasm.

I told you I had an experience I will never forget. 😉

If you would have told me that was possible two decades ago, there is no world in which I would have believed you. You might not even believe me right now.

But, it is true. And it was a Graceful Awakening like no other.

As they say in the East, a meeting with the Divine and the rivers changes course.

I came to understand (pun kind of intended) that we are incarnate to experience what it means to be human. And deep, dark, intense emotion is part of that experience.

Our soul (aka the magnetic monopole) desires the WHOLE experience, not just the parts that our minds have come to judge as “right.”

It would be dishonest to say that I’m perfect at allowing my emotions. I’m definitely not.

The metaphor of personal growth being like an onion didn’t become a cliche for no reason. There are always new layers to explore and more subtle realms to play in.

But I am forever changed and have developed a curiosity about my emotions that just wasn’t possible before. I’ve given myself deeper permission to allow my feelings to flow, to trust their wisdom, and to stay present even when it becomes very intense.

I now know, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that I can not only handle my emotions but also revel in them.

The possibilities are endless, and I can give my soul what it desires more than anything else – depth, richness, and intensity.

This is an amazing part of being fully alive, and I’m here for it. And if you have been resistant to your emotions, I encourage you to open up to the idea that you can revel in them, too.

### The Positive and Negative Sides of Human Design Gate 31

All energy in theHuman Design chart exists on a spectrum of potential.

On the “positive” end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 31 is the energy for influential leadership. Gate 31 knows deep in its bones that empowered people empower others. Disempowered people disempower others. With this as its baseline, it is able to be a highly influential force of nature by expressing the possibilities and potentials for a brighter future for everyone.

On the “negative” end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 31 is the energy for being afraid to step into the role of leader or believing that you are unworthy of being a leader. It can easily use its influence and authority to manipulate others for its own personal gain. Or try to force its vision on others.

You’ll learn about the surprising (but most effective) way to raise your energy frequency in theHuman Design Map + Portal.

The most important thing to raise the frequency of gate 31 is to lead with integrity by knowing your leadership niche. Your Human Design will offer clues in this, especially your conscious sun and yourGene Keys prosperity sequence(unconscious mars, conscious Jupiter, unconscious Jupiter).

### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 31 (Gene Key 31)

The channel of the Alpha (31-7) is defined in my chart.

Gate 31 is defined in my unconscious Saturn.

And, in an interesting twist of fate, Human Design Gate 7 is defined in my conscious Saturn.

How fun?!?!

Eh. Not so much.

Saturn is often a challenge in our charts.

If Santa Claus were divided into two parts of our chart, he would be Jupiter and Saturn.

Jupiter is the benevolent, jolly, grandfather-like energy bringing all the gifts. Saturn is the one checking the list twice.

In other words, Saturn is where we have to check ourselves.

It is a place where we have abundant potential for mastery and transcendence. But only through conscious self-discipline.

And, if you are anything like me, even the mere concept of discipline feels triggering. (Rage?!?!)

I am a free spirit who wants to do what I want whenever I want to do it. Discipline tastes bitter and doesn’t go down smoothly.

But Saturn gives no fucks about how it tastes going down, and if we want the bounty of Jupiter, we must heed his call.

During my first Saturn return, I was just getting clean from drugs, one of my brothers died, and I fell head over heels in love with a narcissistic asshole.

It was a time of great trials, and when my heart began to crack open and see that I have so much more potential than abuse, addiction, and people-pleasing. I can see Leo’s threads running through it. (Both gates 31 and 7 are in the sign of Leo.)

At the time of this writing, my second Saturn return is a handful of years away. With each passing day, I’m checking myself, becoming clearer and clearer about what I need to master to receive my bounty. And it has everything to do with being an Alpha.

Truth be told, I love talking about my other defined channels:

The channel of the Wavelength (48-16) gives me the energy to empower the collective by diving deep into the things I am interested in and bringing them out into the world masterfully.

The channel of the Brain Wave (57-20) gives me the energy to empower myself and others by trusting my intuitive wisdom and giving voice to Truth.The channel of Awareness (61-24) gives me the energy to empower myself and others by asking the big questions in life, like why we are here and allowing the magick of silence to reveal the answers.

Love. Love. Love.

But it’s a whole other story when we get to the channel of the Alpha (7-31). This channel gives me the energy to empower the collective by being a leader rooted in a higher vision of equity, empowerment, and self-awareness.

And, while it has never been a secret to me that others see me as a leader, I’ve mostly not wanted anything to do with it.

Perhaps it has been my 5/2 profile + innocence motivation +gate 7on the conscious side, but I’d rather stay out of the spotlight.

But, in early 2022, something shifted, and I’ll never forget it. I checked myself in the best kind of ways.

I was taking a class for Human Design Projectors, and the energy around leadership kept coming up. In the class, I felt incredibly vulnerable and seen in a way I had never before.

I cannot even describe what it was like to have 13 Projectors looking deeply into my soul simultaneously.

In that space, I was called on to be a leader on numerous occasions. I was asked to speak about this or that topic, and with each invitation, I had zero doubt that I had some magic to bring to the conversation.

In hindsight, this was how I felt when I started writing the very firstmapI ever made. I felt my natural leadership come alive.

Yes, it was a remarkably vulnerable feeling. I felt exposed and raw.

But there was also a quality of integrity and synchronicity—beautiful timing and just oh so right.

The highest potential vibration of the 31-7 was so deeply activated within me that I could no longer push it away. I had to see it. It wasn’t just theoretical anymore.

It was trustworthy.

I AM an Alpha.

The key for me was therecognitionof leading from a space of deep integrity, of that inner knowing that I was the one to guide the ship.

In the past, I’ve often been nominated to lead things that didn’t land right with me.

My spleen would scream no, and, again, maybe my 5/2 was playing a big part here, but I believed that my job was to do whatever people expected of me. And if that meant leading in ways that didn’t feel right for me but helped others, I would just do it anyway.

And true to what Human Design (and theGene Keys) teaches us about gate 31, stepping into the role of the leader has to be a two-way street.

(Just like theprojector recognition and invitation!)

When I am trying to lead shit that doesn’t need or want my leadership, it doesn’t end well. And vice versa, when others want me to lead, and my body says no, it also doesn’t end well.

Since the sacred container of that class, I have been able to step into the role of a win-win leader on many occasions.

I often feel this way in interactions inside theHuman DesignMap portal,in situations where my expertise and insight perfectly match the path ahead.

I even had a dream about someone I care about. From the dream, I knew that I needed to take the lead on a real-life situation we were going through.

It was crystalline clear.  So, I did.

The results were stunning. I lead the situation into more profound harmony and alignment for everyone.

And, because it’s Saturn, I know I’ll be checking myself for years to come. I’ll revisit the 31 and the 7 until I take off the tight shoe called life.

But I have developed an awareness of what this energy looks and feels like on “both sides” of the spectrum.

I know what it’s like to try to lead when I’m not recognized and invited.

I know what it’s like to lead even when I don’t want to.

And, through the diligence of Saturn, I also know what it’s like to lead when it’s win-win.

So, now, I practice. And, perhaps one day, will truly master.

If you are ready to surrender to the bounty in your chart, you will love theHuman Design Map & Portal.It’s a two-part experience in which you’ll learn the most important parts of your Human Design and be expertly guided on an awakening journey of overcoming people-pleasing, making radically authentic decisions, and, above all, trusting yourself.Get yours here.

### The Positive and Negative Sides of Human Design Gate 32

All energy in theHuman Design chart exists on a spectrum of potential.

On the “positive” end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 32 is the energy for guiding one’s community into its highest potential. Gate 32 sees the big picture, can sense what needs to change, and is in a healthy relationship with both success and failure. With this perspective, it is able to lead its family, friends, and community into a state of well-being without getting thrown off by the “failures” along the way.

On the “negative” end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 32 is the energy for using fear as fuel for unhealthy relationships and community dynamics such as codependency, hierarchy, and pressuring others to conform. It can isolate itself from its family, friends, or community due to a belief that you must go through life alone. Or become immersed in groupthink, cults, or fundamentalist systems that reject the outer or natural world.

You’ll learn about the surprising (but most effective) way to raise your energy frequency in theHuman Design Map + Portal.

In the meantime, start noticing when you are feeling OCD, cultish or like a know it all but don’t be an asshole to yourself. Treat yourself the way you would a small child – with love, curiosity, and understanding.

### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 32 (Gene Key 32)

Like most of the tribalhuman design circuitry, Gate 32 is undefined in my chart. In fact, relative to my individual and collective circuitry, I have very little tribal definition in my chart.

After many years of deconditioning, through Human Design and otherwise, I’ve come to understand that I’ve never really valued being part of a group. My attachment to being liked was more about who I thought I should be, rather than what actually feels true for me.

I would even go so far as to say that groups are hard for me. I thrive 1:1 but become easily overwhelmed when in a group environment.

Other than mymapportal community, where I am the “leader”, I mostly find myself “on the edge” groups and rarely feel “part” of them.

That is especially true in groups where the “leaders” are put on pedestals and worshiped or where you “have to” believe and value the same things to be accepted. That kind of thinking has never really made sense to me. My autonomy has always been more important than group think.

For a long time, I made that mean that something was wrong with me, that I was unlikable, or that I was a “bad” person.

And I can see the threads of Gate 32 running all through it.

When we were cavepeople, we lived in small, close knit communities, often of only around 100 people.

Everyone played a role in the survival of its tribe. If you couldn’t play your given role, you were banished and left to die alone.

In other words, success was dependent on the group structure and failure meant imminent death.

This has created a deep lineage of fear around belonging and a world where groupthink is revered.

But, the world is changing; we are moving into a new aeon.

We are headed into a time where true success is dependent on individual empowerment rather than blind adherence. And it is why I am so honored to do the work I do with theHuman Design Map.

We, you and me, are the leading edge of this change. And I am here for it.

Now, of course, doesn’t mean that groups, families, or communities are dying all together. In fact, I think we are seeing them begin to take shape in whole new ways.

The old structures that have been held up by dogma, echo chambers, and authoritarian leadership are crumbling.

They are being rebuilt with the well-being of individuals in mind. We are moving into the awareness that a group of empowered individuals is actually stronger than ones made of disempowered people.

When I look at my experience with the group structures in my life, I can see that my definition of success was always rooted in individual empowerment.

And, on some level, I’ve always trusted that empowered individuals create empowered groups, and empowered groups create an empowered collective.

I don’t have the energy to surrender to groupthink, fundamentalism, or “leader” worship. And, if that means staying on the edges, so be it. I’d rather be inside themapportal blazing a new trail of empowered individuals, anyway. That is what success means to me.

### The Positive and Negative Sides of Human Design Gate 33

All energy in theHuman Design chart exists on a spectrum of potential.

On the “positive” end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 33 is the energy for making ample space for reflection. Gate 33 believes that there is beauty in all things, including painful memories from the past. If you are only willing to see it, and will allow it, experiences and memories of the past can be alchemized into wisdom.

On the “negative” end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 33 is the energy for isolation or hiding from the world, especially when the wisdom of harmful collective events has not revealed itself yet. It can act out of fear or anger in an attempt to force wisdom onto others or throw the past into the faces of others.

You’ll learn about the surprising (but most effective) way to raise your energy frequency in theHuman Design Map + Portal.

The most important thing to raise the frequency of gate 33 is to learn how to hold space for the discomfort that comes from waiting for the wisdom of the past to reveal itself.

### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 33 (Gene Key 33)

Gate 33 is in the throat center of the Human Design chart. When we are looking at the throat center, we are always looking at how the energy that swirls around inside of us (thoughts, memories, visions, feelings, emotions, intuition, instincts) manifest in the outer world; it’s the impact our words and actions have on the people, places, and things around us.

And while “impact” and the throat center are often associated with Manifestor types in Human Design, the throat center actually reveals a different story.

Most of the gates in the throat are, in fact,projected energy.Human Design Gate 20is a bit of an oddball because while inprojector typesit is projected, it is also one part of the only manifesting generating channel, the 34-20.

To me, as a Projector type with a heavily defined throat, that tells us something important about the throat andhowit impacts the world.

All types of energy – projected, manifested, and generated (via mani gen) – reveal themselves to the world through the throat.  And, at its core, all throat energy is about transformation, which is distinct from evolution.

Evolution happens in the root center of the Human Design chart. It’s about how our genes – the blueprint of our bodies – change over long periods of time. It is the adaptations that ensure our survival in the sometimes very harsh climates of Earth.

Transformation, on the other hand, is more rapid and is about the spiritual structures that underpin how we show up in the world.

To take this even a bit further, if we look at the throat center in the context of its correspondences to the Kabbalah Tree of Life, we see that it corresponds to the invisible sphere on the tree known as Daath.

In High Magick circles, when our consciousness rises to the level of Daath, it is called crossing the abyss.

Crossing the abyss isthe momentwe become aware that we are one with the Divine. Not just theoretically aware, either. It is an awareness that you can no longer forget. And itrequiresyou to walk very differently in the world when you know thateverything is you.

Spiritually speaking, it is the “final frontier” on the way to embodying unity consciousness (aka enlightenment) the way masters like Jesus, Buddha, Krishna, etc did.

Enlightenment occurs in Kether, which corresponds to the head center in Human Design. The space between Daath and Kether removes the miniscule specks of dust off the mirror of your consciousness and makes it pristinely clean.

And, that brings me back to gate 33 and its pivotal role in our spiritual transformation.

Gate 33 is undefined in my chart, which means it is a place of amplifying patterns, learning, and letting go of attachment. It is (hopefully!) a place wherewise usewill become the norm.

Whether that happens for me in this lifetime or not, what I can say for sure is that it is crystal clear to me that the world desperately needs the brilliance of Gate 33.

We, as a collective, are starting to become aware of how trauma from the past holds us back in the present. Unhealed trauma not only puts a halt on our evolution as a species, but also our transformation as souls.

It is obvious to me that if we don’t have the capacity to process the wild and twisted shit that happens in this world, we stay stuck. And here is the critical part – we cannot do that alone. We need others to hold space for us in the processing.

And most of the people alive right now never had that. The high frequencies of gate 33 have been sorely missing.

We’ve been so stuck in survival most that our culture pushes “getting over it”, moving on, and candy-coated forgiveness. And that just makes things worse.

We need safe space to breathe, reflect, and process. We must rebuild trust with our body, nervous system, and authentic emotions.

We need to feel seen, heard, and understood in our vulnerability. We need support and people who are willing to hold healing space, rather than to try to jump in and “fix” things.

And that is what gate 33 does.

I am grateful for the people in my life that can hold that kind of space for me. I absolutely would not be where I am today without them. And, it is my intention to hold that kind of space inside theHuman Design Map portal, too.

At its core, Human Design is a path of transformation. And we have to confront some big truths when we make the holy decision to trust ourselves and our inner wisdom as the north star of our lives.And whether our journey involves Human Design or not, it is not about just moving on from the past. It’s about moving through. It is about being present with yourself, and being witnessed, as you peel the layers and let go of the fear, the anger, and the shame.

It takes courage. And compassion. And an immense capacity to feel all of the things.

My deepest prayer is that, as a society, we aren’t just evolving, but also transforming. I hope that we will come to undoubtedly understand that traumatized people cannot expand into the most aligned version of themselves. And that what the world needs most is more people who are walking the path of surrendered alignment.

I can see it happening. In some circles, it’s even cool to talk about trauma and healing wounds from the past.

In the meantime, I’ll be over here healing my shit, leaning on the people who know how to hold space, and doing the same for others (here).You can’t rush your healingDarkness has its teachingLove is never leavingYou can’t rush your healingTrevor Hall, You Can’t Rush Your Healing, Kala

### The Positive and Negative Sides of Human Design Gate 34

All energy in theHuman Design chart exists on a spectrum of potential.

On the “positive” end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 34 is the energy for sovereignty, empowerment, and steady vision. The 34 empowers you to cultivate inner strength, faith, and flow to make your visions a reality.

On the “negative” end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 34 is the energy for pushing or forcing your dreams into reality. A lack of clear vision can make the 34 feel drained of time, energy, and resources.

You’ll learn about the surprising (but most effective) way to raise your energy frequency in theHuman Design Map + Portal.

In the meantime, start noticing when you are feeling shy, busy or visionless but don’t be an asshole to yourself. Treat yourself the way you would a small child – with love, curiosity, and understanding.

### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 34 (Gene Key 34)

Gate 34, located in thesacral center, isundefinedin my chart; that means it’s an archetype that reveals a lot of wisdom in my life. And due to the specificmechanicsof my design, it is a place where I get a lot of opportunities to become wiser. 😂

In my chart provided above, you’ll notice the 57-20 channel of the Brainwave is defined and the way that interacts with gate 34 has a few layers.

I won’t get into all of them here. For now, the place I want to point out is thathuman design Gate 57is the gate defined in the conscious sun of myincarnation cross.

Being 70% of your energy, the conscious sun is the most important gate in your chart; it’s the key archetype you are here to become adept in. Your conscious sunpolishes the mirrorof your soul like nothing else.

So, with gate 57 in my conscious sun, an important part of my incarnation is to become adept in trusting my intuition and creating a life that fosters intuitive clarity. And, as a projector type, soak in the recognition I receive when others benefit from my clarity.

But despite what you may have been taught by new-age or religious rhetoric, becoming adept is never about bypassing the “low” or “negative” side of thespectrum.

Your conscious sun is not supposed to be all rainbows and butterflies. Because everything going perfectly isn’t how you become adept at something.

Prowess with any energy, not just thehuman design gates, is about integration of all its parts (not just the “good” parts) and integrations naturally leads to the ability to consciously direct energy in an aligned way.

This is one of the many reasons why I love Human Design and what I do inside theHuman Design Mapportal. The Human Design system gives you amapthat points you in the direction of your natural prowess.

When you are looking at your design in an objective and empowered way, you will clearly see where you are bypassing instead of integrating your most potent sources of energy.

In themapportal, I show you “how” to integrate and reclaim all of that energy in a skillful and conscious way. (Hint: it happens through radical self acceptance, self-worth, and valuing yourself!)

Anyway, back to my experience with the electromagnetics of gate 34 and the 57 in my conscious sun.

What I’ve learned through experience is that becoming wise with gate 34’s energy is an important part of being adept at trusting my intuition and making space for intuitive clarity.

Whether I am encountering someone with gate 34 defined, or it’s active in the transits, learning how to be powerful and sovereign seems to be a key for fostering intuitive clarity.

Like I talk about in the 36 channels course (inside theHuman Design Mapportal), each end of a channel offers balance to the other side.

Channels are kind of like peanut butter and jelly. Peanut butter and jelly are both delicious on their own. But bring them together and the balance of salty, sweet, earthy, and light is why kids all over the US have them in their lunch boxes.

The 34 and 57 balance and harmonize one another.

If I am giving my sovereignty away, there is no way I will make the space in my life that is necessary to be a clear channel for Divine Clarity.

If I don’t have a deep understanding of my vision, I won’t be able to hear what it’s telling me.

And if I believe I am powerless in places where I am actually full of power (aka capacity to do something), I will never trust myself and the voice of my intuition.

What beautiful wisdom, indeed.

I am grateful to say that I’ve known some amazing people with the 34definedin their charts. And with every encounter, I am learning more and more about what it means to be powerful in my intuitive clarity.

How does it get any better than that?

When you stand in the truth that you are ready to receive the gifts of Gate 34 (whether it’s defined in your chart or not)…

What is your vision? Where are you headed? What are you creating with your life force energy?

When you have so much faith in your vision becoming real that it’s as good as done in heart and mind, what actions do you take? What energy do you bring to the way you move through your days? What is your way of BEING in the world?

What are your indicators of right timing? What ways does the Divine wink and nudge you along?

And, most importantly, are you willing to surrender to your magic? Are you truly open to miracles?

These questions are a good reminder for me. And I hope that they will be powerful for you as well.

I encourage you to take some time with them. Take them out into your world and let their answers reveal themselves to you. Intend for deeper levels of clarity about gate 34.

### The Positive and Negative Sides of Human Design Gate 35

All energy in theHuman Design chart exists on a spectrum of potential.

On the “positive” end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 35 is the energy for adventure, emotional experiences, and learning. Gate 35 knows that curiosity is magic and life is meant to be an adventure. It lives life with great courage and eagerly waits for life’s lessons to reveal themselves through adventure.

On the “negative” end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 35 is the energy for becoming bored and impatient with life. The unsatisfied hunger for adventure can lead to overdoing things like filling sex, food, drugs, alcohol, scroll holes, information seeking, etc. With those emotional buffers in place, Gate 35 struggles to learn from life.

You’ll learn about the surprising (but most effective) way to raise your energy frequency in theHuman Design Map + Portal.

In the meantime, start noticing when you are overindulging in food, drink, drugs, sex, etc. but don’t be an asshole to yourself. Treat yourself the way you would a small child – with love, curiosity, and understanding.

### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 35 (Gene Key 35)

Gate 35 is undefined in my chart, but I had a private client for many years who has the full 35-36 channel of transitoriness. (Side note: because I always get asked — I no longer see clients privately. As of now, I only offer theHuman Design Map & Portal.)

She originally came to my work when I was doing body image-focused coaching, and what an adventure it was.

The most important work we ever did together was giving her the tools and creating the space for her to become present with her emotions and take responsibility for them. As time passed, she developed a level of emotional maturity that I will forever be in awe of.

Through the same tools I teach inHuman Design Map & Portaltoday, she learned how to:

🔥 process her emotions🔥 access the wisdom inside of them🔥 heal the “blocks” to honoring that wisdom.

With that solid emotional foundation, I had the honor and pleasure of witnessing her Gate 35 come to life.

The longer we worked together, the deeper and richer our conversations became. We navigated intense emotional situations with immense Grace and worked through things she didn’t believe were possible.

The thing that I loved most was her insatiable hunger for more.

She was always ready to go on an adventure of the mind, emotions, and soul. Her curiosity was delightfully endless. She genuinely wanted the adventure of the experience and had little attachment to where we ended up.

When I originally wrote this gate 35 contemplation, the full circle of our time together hit me like a ton of bricks.

Ironically, one of the first programs I guided her through wasHungry For More.

At the time, I knew nothing about Human Design. I didn’t know that my intuitive understanding of energy had numbers, keynotes, and archetypal names.

But I did understand Alchemy. And that our so-called “bad” habits are often the result of a deeper hunger. A hunger that cannot be filled by food, drugs, sex, or scroll holes.

I knew that the more willing we are to own and honor those true hungers, the more satisfied, successful, peaceful, and delighted we feel.

And I knew that our emotions are messengers that show up along the way. (This is true no matter your solar plexus definition — emotion (energy in motion) happens all over the chart.)

When we lean into our emotions and trust the wisdom inside of them, we unlock the adventures we long for. We have the fuel necessary to go out there and live life to the fullest—whatever that means for us. We begin to understand that we are spiritual beings having a human experience and that it is meant to be a game, not a torture chamber.

As I’ve often discussed with my ​Human Design Map​ people, emotions are a source of energy (in motion)—one of the things that makes life do what it does. The adventure unfolds when we allow that to happen.

What a beautiful lesson for me to learn and witness. She taught me so much, and I am so much wiser because of it.

I’m still in touch with her today. I am grateful to have watched her step into such a beautiful expression of the 35-36. She will go down in history as one of my life’s most significant client relationships.

Here’s to the adventure of life.

### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 36 (Gene Key 36)

Gate 36 is undefined in my chart. As such, learning to be compassionate, with myself and others, has been a key source of life lessons.

About 15 years ago, I’d been clean (from drugs) for a few years. But I was starting to see that I had simply traded drugs for food.

I was binging almost every single day and hated myself to the core. I deeply believed that I was inherently flawed and broken beyond repair.

Thankfully, through several synchronicities, I found myself in a group treatment program (outpatient) for eating disorders.

We were often given homework; the first assignment was to start noticing how we spoke to ourselves.

At that point, I hadn’t done any training in coaching or energy healing. I didn’t know how the brain worked, I assumed that thoughts and feelings were the same things, and I was in deep denial of my intuition.

I thought my emotions were “the truth” of who I really was.

To say that I was in for a rude awakening would be the understatement of the century.

When I started actually paying attention to what I was thinking about myself, I noticed that I’d regularly call myself a fat pig, lazy, and good-for-nothing.

That was illuminating. I had no idea how mean I’d been to myself for so long.

But the real awakening was realizing I had a choice in how I thought about myself—my thoughts are my free will.

And while I understand that traditional Human Design doesn’t “believe in” free will, there is absolutely no denying that we can choose and change how we think about anything. That is just a scientific fact.

(Showing you what to actually do to change the way you think of yourself is at the heart of what I do inside theHuman Design Map portal.)

For me, realizing that my thoughts were a choice was a pivotal moment in my life. And the idea that I could infuse my thoughts with compassion for myself was nothing short of a miracle.

But, like most people who are steeped in the self-hatred tea, I didn’t really know what it meant to “be” compassionate.

And I honestly spent years trying to figure it out.

I can’t say that I have it 100% figured out. Because, well, the game of life is no fun without contrast.

But it is one of my key practices.

I’ve learned that compassion, whether for ourselves or others, is about having anembodiedunderstanding that we are human beings.

We are all a mix of shadow and light, high frequencies and low frequencies, conscious and unconscious.

And we can choose that perspective for anyone at any time and in any situation – yourself and your darkest secrets included.

To be clear – choosing compassion isn’t about spiritual bypassing.

It is about embracing all your parts, being present with your humanity, and honoring who you must become to find the compassion that already dwells within you.

This involves a lot of shadow work (something I teach to myHuman Design Mapclients) and pulling out the roots of your compassionless stories.

And the ripple effects of that practice really are a miracle.

It automatically flows into the other side as we practice compassion for ourselves or others.

When I can be compassionate for your humanity, I surrender to mine. When I can be compassionate for my humanity, I surrender to yours.

It can only work that way.

And if you’ve read this far, I’m sure that you can agree that the world needs a little more of that.

### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 37 (Gene Key 37)

Gate 37 is undefined in my chart, but I have a wild number of significant relationships with people with the 37-40 channel defined.

Because I have been exposed to it, often daily, I have come to understand thefull spectrumof its expression and am heading its wisdom.

Gate 37 is part ofthe tribal circuit, which focuses on what is “right” for the family, community, or group. I only have hanging gates in the tribal circuit; all of my channels are a mix ofindividualandcollective circuitry(two in each).

(I do a deep dive into channels and circuits inside the portal of theHuman Design Map.)

I’ve never felt like it was my job to ensure a family, community, or group stays together. In fact, the majority of my adult life has been in estrangement from most of my family.

But, I have developed relationships with people who are my “chosen family.” And what I have learned over time is that the full spectrum of gate 37 is truly magnificent energy.

Yes, gate 37 can be hella controlling and codependent AF on one side of the spectrum.

But, it also has the capacity for deep empathy, mutual respect, and understanding that empowered individuals actually are what make an empowered family or group.

The higher purpose of gate 37 is to embody healthy boundaries, communicate clearly, and have an attitude of cooperation instead of codependence. I’ve seen that it can find a win-win in even the most challenging family dynamics. And will set firmer boundaries when necessary.

In recent years, numerous people have told me they admire my boundaries and how I communicate during challenges. They have even said that I’m graceful with my boundaries and willingness to communicate; hearing that shocks me every time.

Because, uh, it rarely feels graceful on the inside.

I vividly remember one of the first firm boundaries I ever set.

I literally yelled at a family member to get the fuck out of my house.

I swam in shame for days after that.

I eventually apologized for yelling but made it clear that the boundary stands. Their behavior was not, and will never be, welcome in my home.

I learned so much from that experience.

First of all, the boundary nor the shame killed me.

That sounds like a joke, but when we hold such deep conditioning, the nervous system interprets stepping outside the norm as a literal threat to survival. Understanding that is an essential part ofdeconditioning.

In that experience, I also learned to love the part of me that can be an asshole sometimes. It’s the part of me that stands for what I believe in, is clear about my values, and has no problem saying what is true for me. (Gate 49!)

And just like I teach myHuman Design Mapclients, the key is learning to love and value those taboo parts of ourselves. We can channel those parts consciously instead of letting them leak out sideways and causing all manner of chaos in our lives.

As I’ve become more in touch with my boundaries and have stopped being so afraid of being seen as an asshole or bitch for having them, I have become a bit more graceful with them.

I can be clear and do so in a way that honors what is true without being unnecessarily unkind. And, when the situation calls for it, I can also go into straight-up bitch mode without shame.

It still feels uncomfortable sometimes. And, from time to time, I need to be reminded that boundaries are a beautiful thing.

But I have it deep in my bones that healthy boundaries and communication are possible in relationships. I’ve had too many positive experiences with my boundaries to believe otherwise.

These days, because I have shored up so many of the blatantly apparent boundaries, the work is more subtle. There is more nuance and a requirement to go deeper under the surface than my initial anger or defensiveness.

But it is worth doing, and I’m grateful to bear witness to the people who’ve embodied the highest frequency of gate 37. Even if it means becoming BFFs with my inner bitch.

If you want to become BFFs with your inner bitch so that you can set healthy boundaries, too, I’ll show you how inside theHuman Design Map + Portal.

### The Positive and Negative Sides of Human Design Gate 38

All energy in theHuman Design chart exists on a spectrum of potential.

On the “positive” end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 38 is the energy for fighting for a purpose. The 38 enjoys the pressure (created by the root center) to evolve and make life meaningful. It is the energy to fight for what is “right.”

On the “negative” end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 38 is the energy for fighting for the sake of fighting and can have a tendency to believe that life is meant to be an unhealthy struggle.

You’ll learn about the surprising (but most effective) way to raise your energy frequency in theHuman Design Map + Portal.

### My Personal Experience with Human Design Gate 38 (Gene Key 38)

Gate 38 isundefinedin my chart but my husband has it defined in his conscious earth, which means it’s the energy that grounds him. And sinceHuman Design Gate 28is defined in my chart (4 times!), we create the whole channel of struggle together.

And I can confidently say that my husband has both practically and energetically taught me so much about suffering and struggling. Not because he is so much better or worse at it than I am, but because it has been such a potent mirror for how I show up in the face of struggle.

(That’s the way all “attraction” channels work in Human Design, the other person because a mirror for how we handle the undefined side in our own design. And through that, we become wiser in that specific energy.)

In my relationship with him, I’ve very clearly seen the conditioning that leads me to believe that suffering and struggle are noble.

In our current culture, we worship at the altar of suffering and struggle.

We often coalesce around the fires of complaining, one-upping our problems, and making sure everyone knows what a victim we are to the shit sandwiches of life.

We use complaining as a shitty substitute for connection and true intimacy. Sometimes, venting our woe-is-me stories is the backbone of our closest relationships.

Suffering and struggle have become a badge of honor.

My suffering badge of honor took the form of believing that I was meant to be a dumping ground for bullshit.

As a5/2 profile, people often saw me as someone who could save them, and I believed them. And I thought that, somehow, this made me a good and worthy human.

But, in walks my husband, and everything changes.

With definedintegration channelsin his design, he operates differently than anyone I’ve ever known.

(I teach a deep dive on all 36 channels inside theHuman Design Mapportal.Get yours here.)

Our relationship has challenges, of course, but he has never been one to assume that I’ll clean up any metaphorical messes he has made with his life. In fact, the opposite has been true.

And that provided a potent mirror for my healing.

His way of being, combined with understanding myhuman design profile, showed me how deeply I was creating unnecessary suffering by trying to swoop in to save a day that didn’t need saving.

As I peeled back those layers, I started to see the beauty of gate 38. It is truly magical and has taught me so much.

Some say that we “must” struggle – that life is a struggle. Others say that suffering is optional or simply a state of mind.

And while there is at least a little truth in every cliche, it isn’t so black and white. There is nuance and many shades of gray.

Gate 38 invites us to look under the surface of our struggles, suffering, and victim mindset.

(I’m not talking about actual victims of crimes, etc. I’m talking about the mindset that you are a victim of life itself.)

Suffering doesn’t mean we are doing life right or wrong. It isn’t that we should or shouldn’t struggle. And being honest and vulnerable about where we actually are in our lives is a beautiful thing.

It isn’t about judging ourselves (or others) at all.

(Removing judgment and replacing it with curiosity is a huge part of deconditioning and is the foundation of what I teach you in theHuman Design MapPortal.)

Instead, when we are deep in the throes of struggle, with no end in sight, it’s a sign that we are putting unnecessary pressure on ourselves to be a certain way.

Usually, that pressure comes in the form of automatically making our situation mean something terrible about ourselves or life (gate 28) and fighting for something that isn’t real or doesn’t actually matter.

And in that state of stress, we forget the magick of who we really are.

But when we go within and become present with any sense of struggle, suffering, and victimhood, our bodies will show us what is worth fighting for and what isn’t.

And, in my book, knowing your Divinity is worth fighting for.

The right amount of pressure isn’t a built-in recipe for struggle.

When it’s the right amount for you, it won’t weigh you down; it will move you deeper into recognizing your Divine Nature. It can help you find yourself in the Divine game of hide-and-seek.

And finding that just right amount of pressure is all part of the fun.

I’ll teach you the “how” inside theHuman Design Mapportal.

### The Positive and Negative Sides of Human Design Gate 39

All energy in theHuman Design chart exists on a spectrum of potential.

On one end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 39 is the energy for using pressure to find passion and spirit in life. When gate 39 takes full responsibility for its emotions and allows others to do the same, it transforms emotional energy into clarity. Its most sacred gift is provoking heightened states of emotional and spiritual awareness.

On the other end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 39 is the energy for taking responsibility for other people’s emotions and being a people pleaser. It can intentionally push other people’s buttons in revenge or as an attempt to hurt people.

### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 39 (Gene Key 39)

With the full57/20, I often sit with things for a while before fully expressing them. And that is exactly what happened when I was contemplating this gate.

Gate 39 is undefined in my chart, but my husband has it in his conscious sun.

So, when I first started writing this post, I thought the words would just flow out of me.

But by the mystery of Grace, that isn’t what happened. I was provoked into something deeper and more clarifying.

I had an intuitive knowing that something was “coming through” the 57/20 and that I just needed to be present until the words popped in.

Then, shortly after the witching hour on the day of the original writing, I was struck by the etymology of the word:

Provocation.

Prois a word element that meansforward, forth, toward the front.

Vocationhas a couple of different meanings but the roots of it arecall or calling.

In the Gene Keys, there is a placement in thePearl Sequencecalled vocation which is also the core wound in theVenus Sequence.

(If you are in business, you’ll learn how this placement relates to your audience and marketing inside theHuman Design Mapportal.)

The Gene Keys “vocation” and “core wound” correspond to the unconscious Mars placement in the Human Design chart. When we heal the core relational wound, it awakens our life calling and becomes our vocation.

My unconscious Mars placement is gate 59 line 5. Human Design Gate 59 is the gate of “dispersion” and is all about breaking down the walls to intimacy and vulnerability.

Mars is where we “must” express energy outward like an arrow. It can be aggressive and passionate. And if we don’t express the energy effectively, those arrows turn in and cause harm in our inner world.

And while none of that might seem related to the 39, all of these connections went off like a clarity bomb in my brain.

In that clarity, I could see so clearly the role that my husband has played in bringing forth my vocation.

I’d been married to him for just over 14 years when I wrote this post, and I already knew that he is provoking. There has always been something about him that has felt like it calls me out – even when he isn’t saying a word.

I think part of it is my 5/2 profile, for sure, but with him, I have to own my shit in a way that is more subtle, under the surface, and mostly unspoken.

It has challenged me to open up, to be vulnerable, and break down walls that I didn’t even know existed before I met him.

And, as discussed inthe Gene Keys Pearl Sequence, it has absolutely unlocked so much for me in the realm of prosperity and the work I do in the world.

Before now, I had never thought of gate 39 in quite this way. It’s a strong connection to vocation and what we express in the world.

It seems pretty obvious now. Gate 39 pokes the bears. And it seems only natural that the best ones to poke are the sorest spots.

And while my husband isn’t a Projector (he is a mani gen), gate 39 is a projected energy. Which means that it cuts deep. All projected energy does.

As a Projector myself, I know how important it is to wait for recognition and invitation. It is completely exhausting to try to guide someone that isn’t open to it. And I’ve learned not to waste my energy on someone who doesn’t want to be provoked. Because if they aren’t ready to wake up the bears, nothing will help them see it.

And my M.O. is usually quite blunt and direct. I don’t tend to sugar coat and I call ‘em like I see ‘em. The people that need that, love it. It is what they most crave. (Sound like you?Grab your map and meet me in the portal.)

But, what my husband and this contemplation has shown me is that projected energy isn’t always about a grand display of ugly crying. It can also cut deep very quietly and it sneaks up on you.

No matter how it gets expressed, provocation is always directing us back to authenticity, integrity, and the most valuable contribution we can make in the world. So good to know, right?

With its proper boundaries in place, it is empowered to dedicate vast amounts of energy in service to its community.

### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 40 (Gene Key 40)

In the bookChants of Lifetime by Krishna Das, he starts the book by sharing the story of Neem Karoli Baba (his Guru and my Baba) sending him back to America to work through attachments.

Krishna Das didn’t want to go back to America; he had planned to live out the remainder of his life in India.

As he leaves the ashram, he shouts to Baba,

“How can I serve you in America?”

Baba shouts back:

“If you have to ask how to serve, it isn’t service.”

True to form, this one sentence struck me like a lightning bolt (human design gate 51).

With my undefined will, undefined gate 40, and surrounded by an astounding number of people with the full 40/37, I have held deep conditioning around being of service and worthiness.

I spent most of my life trying to figure out what exactly I needed to do to be good enough and worthy of love.

But what this story, and Baba, have shown me, time and time again is that worthiness is a construct of the mind. In the eyes of the Divine, it isn’t a real thing.

“True” service is just a natural process for a healthy will center.

But when we “serve” others to prove that we are enough, good, or worthy, we only serve a limited identity of the ego.

With this awareness, I have made it a conscious practice to notice when I’m giving in an attempt to be seen as good and when it is a natural expression of authenticity.

When I am doing something for others because I believe I have to, it is exhausting. It depletes everything I have to keep that up.

But when service comes from an authentic place, it is a completely different experience for everyone. It expands rather than collapses.

When it is authentic, rather than performative, I have this deep knowing that my next step is one of service. It is the natural state of receiving and the final stage of alchemy.

(You’ll learn all of the stages of alchemical transformation inside theHuman Design Mapportal.)

When we have gone through our alchemical process and fully stepped into a “higher” state of consciousness, the service to others literally just pours out.

When we are showing up for ourselves, honoring our boundaries, and expanding our consciousness, it can only work that way. You literally cannot stop that kind of flow. And there is no questioning whatsoever.

And, while I can’t know for sure, I think this is exactly what Baba was getting at in that conversation with Krishna Das.

Service isn’t something we have to try to do. It isn’t something that is expected from some mysterious bearded dude in the sky. It isn’t a performance for egoic eyes.

Service isexpansive. It creates a ripple effect of expanded consciousness all around it.

The form doesn’t matter. There is no right or wrong way.

And when we are questioning whether or not we are doing it the right, that is a signal that we’ve lost the plot. We’ve become wrapped up in the story that we need to prove ourselves to be worthy of love.

Those moments are not a time to double down, grit your teeth, and push through. They are moments to reconnect with yourself and to ask yourself what you would be doing if you weren’t trying to prove your goodness.

The real trick is letting that be enough.

## Affirmations for Human Design Gate 40

Using your Human Design to create affirmations is a powerful way to activate the full potential of your chart. Here are some affirmations for Gate 40:

I balance my heart of service with deep self care.

### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 41 (Gene Key 41)

In Western culture, we think of the new year January 1st.

But, in Human Design, the new year begins when the sun enters gate 41. And in the Gene Keys, gate (key) 41 is known as the “start codon,” which initiates the sequencing of our literal genes.

All that to say, the energy of gate 41 is essential when it comes to new beginnings. And while I love new beginnings, gate 41 isundefinedin my chart.

I’ve always had a love-hate relationship with goal setting, resolutions, and making big proclamations about what I wanted to do during the year.

With my undefined root, it feels like more pressure than I can consistently regulate in a healthy way. And, with heavily defined splenic authority, making decisions and committing to what I’ll be doing a year from now has yet to work.

The spleen is all about the present moment; it does not decide or commit the way the will center or sacral center do. As long as there is no immediate threat or it isn’t stuck in fight or flight, the spleen doesn’t really “care” about the future.

Intentions, on the other hand, feel much better in my body and despite a common misconception in the Human Design space intentions are not just “the mind.” And as I talk about in my post onhow to make affirmations work, aligning your intentions with the truths of your Human Design is potent magick.

Intentions are a key alchemical tool that arise from the depths of our G center, where the magnetic monopole (aka soul) resides. They ripple out through thenine energy centersand draw us towards our next plane of consciousness.

And that is happening whether our mind is conscious of the intention, or not. The real magick happens when we bring our intentions into the light and start walking the path of alignment.

Another key thing to note about intentions is that, unlike goals, they are not “check-off-able.” When you set a goal – say painting the bedroom – once it is done, it is done. That isn’t to say that you’ll never have to paint the bedroom again but there is a finish line.

Intentions don’t work like that. Intentions are focused on cultivatinga vibein the present moment – no matter the circumstances. They focus on who you arebeing, the energy you bring to your life, and how aligned your everyday choices are with the truth of who you are.

Intentions initiate the alchemical process, leading to the accomplishment of The Great Work (aka enlightenment), and reveal the path of alignment with each passing moment.

I teach a step-by-step process for using intentions with your Human Design in theHuman Design Mapportal. If you are an existingmapclient, log into your dashboard and start at the beginning of the deconditioning toolbox.

When you are working with your intentions, it is important to not get them mixed up with your conditioning. You want them to arise from that deeper, soulful place (of the G center) and resonate with the sound of Truth.

If they are coming from a place of needing to prove yourself, keep up with the Jones’, or sacrifice yourself for the sake of others, listen deeper. Make some space for plenty ofPure Aura Timeand remember the magick of the conscious sun in yourincarnation cross.

(You’ll get an explanation of all four gates in your cross in yourHuman Design Map.)

And that is where harnessing the energy of gate 41 comes in for me.

Gate 41 is dreamy and fantastical, and connecting withhuman design gate 30in the solar plexus, inspires a deeper relationship with how lifefeels. It helps us to tap into the desires and dreams that are hidden under the surface.

Soft. Generous. And forgiving of being human.

Most importantly, though, it shows us how fulfillment happens, whether we are looking at goals or intentions.

Evolution happens through fulfillment. And fulfillment happens through aligned action.

Whether we thrive with concrete goals or prefer more soulful intentions, we must move in the direction we want. We have to take the next aligned step, trust in the timing of life, and be open to having our deepest desires come true.

Sometimes, the next aligned step is going to be a nap. Or waiting. Or connecting with the people who can help you.

Other times, it will be ass-in-chair, doing the work.

Either way, what I’ve come to understand is that beingopento fulfillment, rather than forceful, is where the most opportunity for alchemical expansion is.

When we are under unhealthy amounts of pressure, striving, and trying to force shit, we close ourselves off from the more profound satisfaction, success, peace, and delight we seek.

But when we soften and surrender to the natural impulses of growth of evolution, fulfillment is a sure thing. Growth and evolution are a natural by-product of alignment with our deeper seeds of truth.

Because remember – the magnetic monopole (aka soul) only attracts; it cannot push things away. Much like Jupiter, it is benevolent and expansive.

There is no force required, even when doing the ass-in-chair hard work.

It is only our misaligned conditioning that keeps us small, tight, and striving for less than our full potential.

Our seeds of Truth want to flourish, blossom, and express themselves. And when we open and allow, it can only be that way.

### My Personal Experience with Human Design (Gene Key 42)

Gate 42 is undefined in my chart, but I do haveHuman Design Gate 53defined (the other side of the Channel of Maturation). And, to be honest, I’ve often found myself trying to solve the “never finish what I start” problem.

I am really good at starting things. Like, really, really good.

But finishing is a whole other story. And it has been a source of shame for my entire life.

Understanding all of my neurodivergence has helped heal some of that. But learning more about my chart—a non-sacralbeing, undefinedroot, hanging53—helped me put it all in a context that made it easy to understand and practical.

My energy for finishing is meant to be inconsistent; I didn’t incarnate to finish everything I start. I incarnated to gain wisdom about what it means to finish the things that are aligned and let go of the rest.

By taking off the pressure of having to finish everything I start, I was able to notice—without judgment—how many “open loops” I had in my life.

Some of those loops were obvious—half-finished art projects or laundry that had to be rewashed 12 times because I kept forgetting it—but others were sneakier.

Like the dining room table full of antique store finds I never quite got around to cleaning, finding a place for, or even unpacking. It seemed logical to just leave all of it on the table until it was “processed.”

But, as I started looking closely at the “not finishing” pattern in my life, that logic started to fall apart.

See, my husband and I love to go thrifting and antique shopping. Our home décor has an eclectic organic modern meets mystical sigil magick vibe. I love the alchemy of taking something old and giving it a new purpose (hello,Human Design Gate 28) and old junk really works for that.

But as gate 42 worked its magick on me, I could clearly see that all of those unpacked antiques were a physical manifestation of overloading my to-do list. It was about the antiques. But it was also about more than the antiques.

The bottom line was this:

I was putting way too much stuff on my to do list. I had so much “to do” that it would take many lifetimes to finish it all—and the piles on the dining room table were just adding even more.

At first, this awareness was really depressing.

I wondered if it meant that we couldn’t spend our weekends wandering around our favorite shops. Or exploring new shops on our travels to seeTrevor Hallplay. Or if I’d have to settle for getting mainstream decor while buying toothpaste at Target.

But even deeper than that, the conditioning of my undefinedwill centerstarted to speak.

And suddenly, clear as day, I knew that my never-ending to-do list was a way I attempted to prove my worthiness.

(Side note: If you notice the same pattern of trying to prove your worth, I’ll help you unwind it in the​Human Design Map & Portal​.)

To be honest, though, part of me didn’t want to let go of the idea that one day I’d get my shit together. That part loved the belief that one day I would do enough to earn all the gold stars. That there really was some sort of list I could check off to get the coveted worthiness award. That one day, I would stop being so broken and be able to just finish what I started.

But, a stronger part of me also knows what I tell my​Human Design Map & Portal​people all the time:

When you are pursuing a life of purpose, you have to take worthiness off the table of discussion. Because here’s the deal:

Worthiness is not a real thing. It is a made-up construct of the ego (will center). And really getting that is an essential part of deconditioning, even if your will center is defined.

When I let go of the idea that I needed to earn worthiness, I developed more discernment about how much I could take on in any given moment.

That’s when I started making different choices—even with the beloved piles of antiques. I started a new experiment:

If the last trip’s stuff isn’t processed, we don’t go on another trip. 😱

I experimented in other ways, too. I stopped saying yes to every single thing that came my way. I learned the difference betweenattention and recognition. I questioned where the energy to start was coming from.

Was it a true point of alchemy in my life (Gate 53)?

Was it aligned with my purpose, calling, wisdom, and authority?

Or was it just another attempt to meet the rules of what I thought I needed to prove that day?

With practice, my “plate” started to get clearer and clearer; I became more and more discerning about what was mine to start and finish, and what wasn’t. Eventually, I noticed that there was more room in my life to just breathe and be. We even got rid of the dining room table all together.

This experiment ultimately led to a deeper sense of self-compassion. And things look different now.

We buy way less. And I’m more intentional about my mindset going into a thrift or antique store. My to do list is more refined and focused. I keep my big projects to a minimum and aim to focus on the ones that serve my people better, either onmy website, onsubstack, or in the​Human Design Map & Portal​.

I’m definitely not done “becoming wise” in finishing things. And for sure, some random antique that has no place in my home will eventually find its way to me. And I’ll become even wiser.

But, even when it does, I’m not going to be an asshole to myself about any of it. I understand thatworthiness is an optional storythat has nothing to do with my true purpose in this world.

What really matters is being honest with myself and trusting the process as I learn more about the delicate balance between starting and finishing.

If you’re feeling called to explore how old patterns are playing out in your life, the​Human Design Map & Portal​is here to guide you. I won’t promise you’ll finish everything you start—but I will help you uncover what truly matters, and how to follow it without shame, force, or hustle.​Click here to get started​.

### The Positive and Negative Sides of Human Design Gate 43

All energy in theHuman Design chart exists on a spectrum of potential.

On one end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 43 is like being a hotline for Universal wisdom and truth and staying true to inner wisdom . It is like a radio tuned into ideas that create breakthroughs and making space for radical transformation to occur.

On the other end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 43 is the energy for listening to others instead of listening to your own inner wisdom. This clouds your ability to hear your inner truth and can cause worry, doubt, or confusion.

You’ll learn about the surprising (but most effective) way to raise your energy frequency in theHuman Design Map + Portal.

In the meantime, start noticing when you are feeling worried, illogical or rebellious but don’t be an asshole to yourself. Treat yourself the way you would a small child – with love, curiosity, and understanding.

### My Personal Experience with Human Design Gate 43 (Gene Key 43)

Gate 43 isdefinedin my conscious Venus placement. Which indicates that I highly value, and see the beauty in, listening to my own inner wisdom, rather than relying on others to guide me.

AND, because I am a human being who was raised in the era of tribal empowerment and “family values” (1615 – 2026) over individual empowerment and the honoring of inner spirit (2027 – 2438), like almost everyone walking on this planet, I was deeply conditioned to ignore my inner wisdom.

I was taught most of my life that my inner wisdom was wrong, sinful, and too much for the people around me. What I wanted to do with my life was never on the table of discussion. And I was encouraged to ignore the inklings, the moments of insight, and the ring of truth in my own voice.

I know that I am not alone in that.

It is why we are seeing such an increase in people who are interested in systems likeHuman Design, Astrology, the Enneagram, Meyers Briggs, and all the other systems that help people understand themselves better.

We have been taught our entire lives that all power resides outside of ourselves and that the most important thing is to keep other people – especially those in authority – happy.

So, it makes complete sense that we don’t know how to listen to our own inner wisdom! Literally, how could it be any other way. Almost no one on this planet has been taught to go within to find their inner compass. And that is why we see so many people who are stuck in some flavor of theirnot-self themes.With each choice to ignore your inner wisdom and do what other people think you should, you drill into your subconscious that you are not enough, that the power resides outside of you, and that you are unworthy of a life of satisfaction, success, peace, and delight.

When you allow your life to be run by toxic religious beliefs, new-age superstition, and/or patriarchal systems of control,  you perpetuate the story that your inner wisdom means nothing.

And there is only one way out:going within, listening to your inner voice, and doing the healing work it takes to make the leap towards your north star.

The time when we can blame the world around us for our sufferings is quickly passing. It is time to find your internal source of power and use it.

That is exactly what you’ll learn how to do inside theHuman Design Map + Portal.

In the meantime, the first step is to create time and space to actually hear the sound of your inner wisdom ring through you like a bell. And that means time and space that is completely free from the influence of other people’s thoughts, ideas, and insights. I call this “pure aura time” and it is one of the first steps I recommend to all of my map clients.

In essence, pure aura time is you spending time alone, no podcasts, books, music, no work, no social media scrolling, nothing but you, yourself, and you.

Now, that doesn’t mean you need to be precious about it. Your pure aura time does not need to be bubble baths on mountain tops with Unicorns frolicing in fields of rainbows and butterflies.

It can be as simple as driving to work, doing the dishes, or going on a walk – minus the earbuds. It can be taking an extra three minutes on your pee break at work and just breathing. It can be a tiny moment of placing your hand on your heart and tuning into what is really going on with you.

In order to thrive, you need it.

And listen, I don’t use the word “need” lightly.

I am a rebel at heart. When you tell me there is something I need to do, I can assure you that me and my neurodivergent brain will find a way out.

But this is an area that it matters.

Now is the time to make space to hear the sound of your own inner voice. To free your nervous system from the pressure of others’ opinions, to listen to your heart, and to work through the baggage that keeps you from making choices that are aligned with what you hear. Stop giving your power away.

Make the space.

Go within.

Listen to your inner wisdom.

Trust what you hear.

### The Positive and Negative Sides of Human Design Gate 44

All energy in theHuman Design chart exists on a spectrum of potential.

On the “positive” end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 44 is the energy for practicing forgiveness and and learning from mistakes.

Gate 44 has a deep and primal knowing that every moment, including memory,  holds the potential for healing and transformation.

With this knowing, it can guide others to break painful patterns from the past. It uses those patterns as a way to learn, grow, and, most importantly, forgive.

On the “negative” end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 44 is the energy of being afraid to repeat mistakes from the past and using those mistakes as a “reason” to not move forward. This internal resistance to the mistakes of the past actually prevents the ability to transform, learn, and grow.

You’ll learn about the surprising (but most effective) way to raise your energy frequency in theHuman Design Map + Portal.

### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 44 (Gene Key 44)

Gate 44 is defined in my Unconscious North Node.

## Before diving in, let me give you a bit of context by sharing how I interpret some of the mechanics here…

### Conscious and Unconscious

The conscious side of the chart – sometimes referred to as the personality or the mind – is on the right side of the chart. Traditionally, definition on the conscious side is colored in black and reveals who we believe ourselves to be and the primary places where our consciousness is expanding.

The unconscious side of the chart – sometimes called the body or design – is on the left side of the chart. Traditionally, definition on the unconscious side is colored in red and reveals the primary “shadows” that “block” the full expansion of the gates on the conscious side.

By healing and integrating the wisdom of the unconscious side, you automatically expand your capacity for fuller expression of the gates on the conscious side of the chart.

### North and South Nodes with a little Conscious Sun thrown in for good measure

The nodes are like petri dishes for observing the growth and expansion of theincarnation cross.

And because the conscious sun makes up 70% of the energy in the chart, it is the gate where you will see the most growth. Everything else in the chart is in service to that growth.

(I cover the details of your incarnation cross inside theHuman Design Map.)

Before your Uranus Opposition (around age 42), your “petri dish” is the gate in your south node and after, it is the gate in your north node.

### Using the mechanics of my chart as an example, here is what that looks like.

My cross:LAX of the Clarion 2 (57/51, 62/61)

My Conscious Sun:Gate 57– The most important gate in my chart and cross.

My Conscious North Node:Gate 28 – Since my Uranus Opposition has already passed, this is my “petri dish.”

My Unconscious North Node:Gate 44 – And this is the “block” to full expansion and expression ofgate 28.

The highest expression of gate 57 is intuitive clarity and the lowest expression is the discomfort that signals that intuition is being ignored.(I’ll cover the high and low expressions of your incarnation cross inside theHuman Design Map.)

And my conscious north node isgate 28, which is all about our fear of death, taking risks, and deriving purpose from the darkness of life.

So, for me, that means that taking risks and intentionally creating purpose out of the dark stuff of life (28) will grow my capacity to trust my intuition (57).

And in order to do that, I will need to heal my relationship with the past and the mistakes that I’ve made along the way (gate 44).

## Back to gate 44…

And, well, that is exactly how it has played out for me.

As I have gotten older, I’ve done a lot of reflecting on my past and forgiving myself for so many of the mistakes that I’ve made. As I’ve turned the past into wisdom, creating purpose and meaning is much easier for me. It is like the “darkness” of what has been becomes fuel for

For much of my life, I made almost everything in life mean that life was meaningless and that I had no purpose.

With gate 28 in my chart four times, I am no stranger to the darkness of life and turning that into purpose has been a relentless quest. I’ve often used my past as a weapon against myself and as proof that something is wrong with me.

True to gate 24 in my unconscious south node, I have also been someone who ruminates in the past and have had paralyzing fears of repeating the same mistakes.

Now, I am seeing more clearly that mistakes really are just a part of life and that the past only has the meaning we give it. And, even more profoundly, there is actually no reason to revisit the past if it isn’t for the specific purposes of moving forward. What really matters is now and how we are using the energy that is available to us.

And in the cases where revisiting the past is helpful, it must be done with compassion (human design gate 36), forgiveness (human design gate 4), and Grace (human design gate 22).

These days, I am catching myself when I am falling into old patterns of using my past mistakes against myself. I am cultivating the mindset that everything is happening for my awakening (human design gate 51) and that right now is what matters most. I am using the healing process I teach inside theHuman Design Mapportal.

And, most importantly, I am remembering that I am a fallible human being and that is OK.

Now is the only moment that matters. And it is all in service to my intuitive clarity (57).

Using your Human Design to create affirmations is a powerful way to activate the full potential of your chart. Here are some affirmations for Gate 44:

### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 45 (Gene Key 45)

I’ve shared that I haveGate 54(not a typo!) in my mid-heaven (note: mid-heaven does not create definition in Human Design). Taken at face value, myGate 54mid-heaven means that embodying prosperity as a spiritual path is a significant part of the legacy I will leave.

And, while I can’t know what my legacy will be, I do know thatGate 54has been an important mirror for me. I’ve come a long way in my money story (and bottom line!), and letting go of the belief that “money isn’t spiritual” has been a key part of that. As part of that letting go, I’ve had to confront my relationship with Gate 45 directly.

Gate 45 is undefined in my chart. And it’s fair to say that I’ve learned the hard way about managing money and resources. I’m definitely gathering wisdom. ;)

Only recently did I heal the story that I was irresponsible with money.

By looking at my money management situations and habits with clear-eyed compassion, I’ve come to understand that I am a wise steward of money. At this point, I would even go so far as to say that I am smart with money. Of course, I am not perfect—of course—but I’m not irresponsible, clueless, or powerless in handling money.

Essentially, I put my money where my mouth is by using my money for the things that align with my values.

I invest in myself, my dreams, and what matters to me. I donate to causes I care about every month, and I show recognition by paying people for their work. I pay all of the​MAP​ Team members fairly, and I’m the main breadwinner in my house.

I can even go to Target without buying a thing I don’t need and will walk out empty handed if they don’t have what I went for. The profit margins in my business are no longer an afterthought, and I don’t go into debt without deep consideration of the consequences.

Some of that amazes me to be able to say. It makes me feel proud of how far I’ve come.

But it hasn’t always been that way.

For decades, I believed the patriarchal lie that, as a woman, I am irresponsible with money.

I internalized the message that I could not be trusted with money, that I was incapable of understanding how money works, and that managing money was better left to the men in my life.

I had buckets of “evidence” that those stories were true, too. After all, believing is seeing. (not a typo, again!)

When I was 18 years old, one of my brothers — may he rest in power — wrecked my car, and getting it fixed was not an option. I was working a part-time minimum-wage job and couch surfing. And I knewnothingabout how moneyactuallyworks.

I was raised under the guise of scarcity and an assumption that I’d never amount to much (financially or otherwise).

My education about money came down to this:

- Get a job. Any job. It didn’t matter how much I liked it.

- Work really fucking hard for the rest of my life. Retirement wasn’t for people like us.

- Pray that robbing Peter to pay Paul wouldn’t be my fate.

I was also taught that rich people are terrible and that money is the root of all evil.

When the car was wrecked beyond repair, and despite my financial situation, my parents to buy a new one “on credit.”

I did not know what “on credit” meant or that, because of my financial situation, I setting myself up for failure. I did not understand that this decision was setting me up for decades of “bad credit” and shame. And I didn’t know that the salesman telling me I could get a “cosigner” was a clue that I wasn’t ready to take on the loan.

I was told that this was just the way it was.

And it turned into a dumpster fire.

I could not make the payments, and in less than a year, I was being chased by the repo man.

I didn’t know that I should let the cosigner know so they could make the payment. And even if I had known, I would have been too ashamed to tell them. I’m not even sure I understood they could take the car away.

Once I realized what was happening, I tried to hide the car. For my job, I’d park in crazy places and walk really far, and since I was couch surfing, there was no reliable place to find me “at home.”

But, after about a week, the repo man finally caught up with me.

I “ruined” my credit and my cosigner’s credit.

More importantly, my cosigner couldn’t understand why I never came to them when I knew I couldn’t pay.

So, not only did my choice financially haunt me (and them) for years to come, but it also drove a wedge in a deeply valued relationship, too.

From then on, the evidence of my financial irresponsibility only grew. The shame lasted for decades after the repossession fell off my credit report; it seemed obvious that I was too fucked up to handle money wisely.

And, in all honesty, it didn’t matter much, anyway. For most of my twenties, I was broke, on drugs, binge drinking, and avoiding life altogether.

Even after I got completely sober, cleaned up my life, and started my business, I was in extreme cycles of not enough having enough money and, when I did have some, spending it on shit that didn’t matter.

The tables started to run when my income dramatically increased in a short period of time.(Shout out to recognizing myself, calling myself out, and owning the value of my innate gifts with the​Human Design Map​!)

Something one of my mentors said many years ago started to come into focus. She said something like:

“People say that money won’t buy happiness. But having money does solve a lot of problems.

And when you solve your money problems, and you no longer feel afraid or worried about money, you can use all that energy to make an even bigger contribution to the world.

When you have plenty of money, you can easily distribute it to the people who really need it without harming yourself. “

Talk about gate 45 vibes! And it truly changed my life.

Having, making, and being a steward of money is a privilege.

To be clear, I don’t say that as a moral judgment or to say that you don’t “have it hard” in other ways. But only to acknowledge that when you have money, there are things you don’thave to think aboutor consider to live your daily life. You get to use that energy for other things, whereas others have to focus solely on where money will come from to survive.

When you have plenty of money, you don’t have to worry about how the mortgage will get paid. Or how food will end up on the table, the price of eggs, or what store has this or that on sale. You don’t have to decide between putting gas in your car or giving your kid lunch money.

All of that energy can be channeled into other things.

I did not have the privilege of money for most of my life. My family was dirt poor when I was growing up, and most of my adulthood was spent deciding what would get paid and what wouldn’t.

So, when I started making more money, my eyes were opened to how irresponsible I believed I was. And I started to recognize that the way we manage money has two parts:

- Our values. When we don’t know our values (aka the things that matter to us) we will spend our money based on other people’s values, thoughts, and opinions.

- Owning the value we bring to the world. When we don’t embody the value wenaturallybring to the world, we will have shitty boundaries, give until it bleeds, and under-earn.

When we clean those two things up, money and how we manage it completely transform into abundance and generosity. That is what it means to be a good steward of money and what my mentor said all those years ago.

Now, I see that I am actually really good at putting my money where my mouth is. And because I practice what I preach inside the​MAP portal​, I’m also getting better and better at owning the value I have to share with others.

And what I know for sure is that money is a mirror, and a mirror must be polished often.

I can trust myself with money.

I can decide what “being responsible” with money looks like and how important that is to me.

I AM a wise steward of money.

I love circulating money.

I use money to make a more authentic contribution.

I invest in my values.

I own the value I bring to the world.

When I catch myself thinking that I am irresponsible with money, I remind myself of these things. These new ways of thinking are my self-concept now, and I look forward to more and more wisdom about handling money.

### The Positive and Negative Sides of Human Design Gate 46

All energy in theHuman Design chart exists on a spectrum of potential.

On the “positive” end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 46 is the energy for enjoying being alive in a human body. Gate 46 knows that every part of life is an opportunity for Divine Grace and that the body is a vehicle for the soul. In that knowing, it cultivates presence in its body and delights in synchronicity.

On the “negative” end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 46 is the energy for creating chaos in its life by avoiding the present moment or taking life way too seriously. This can lead to buffering with food, drugs, alcohol, or anything else that dulls the body.  It can be prone to Spiritual bypassing, materialism, or ego.

You’ll learn about the surprising (but most effective) way to raise your energy frequency in theHuman Design Map + Portal.

In the meantime, start noticing when you are feeling twisted, strange or depraved but don’t be an asshole to yourself. Treat yourself the way you would a small child – with love, curiosity, and understanding.

### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 46 (Gene Key 46)

Gate 46.6 is defined in my conscious mercury. I interpret that to mean that I am here to communicate the wisdom of embodiment.

(BTW, if you are aHuman Design Mapclient and a business owner, I talk about the relevance of mercury in the context of business inside the portal.)

I also have a defined head with channel61/24(called the channel of awareness), which means that I am no stranger to esoteric knowledge, mysticism, (61) and grounding that with reason (24).

And something I have gotten on my 5th line soap box about a bazillion times is that spiritual knowledge means nothing if it isn’t embodied.

As the cliche goes, we aren’t human beings having a spiritual experience, we are spiritual beings having a human experience.

True to my 46 being in the 6th line, though, it has taken me some time to really see how that plays out in my own life.

I haven’t exactly been a perfect model of being present and reveling in my body. In fact, in my 20’s, I was a drug addict, binge drinker/eater, and smoker. I also repeatedly energetically left my body during times of trauma.

I’ve also experienced chronic illness and pain for most of my adult life; I’ve been bed-bound more than once and occasionally have to walk with a cane.

In the past 15+ years, I’ve done a lot of healing work around my relationship with food, drugs, and alcohol. I’ve been completely sober and a non-smoker for about that time and haven’t binged in over a decade.

And what that healing has shown me, loud and clear, is that the purpose of life is to be presentin the body.  With all the intense feelings and sensations that life brings. Including the ones that hurt like hell.

We aren’t here totranscendthe human experience. We aren’t here to rise above. Or try to “be spiritual.”

It isn’t that we can’t have transcendent experiences or that connecting with a “higher” perspective isn’t useful. But when we try tobethat, instead of what we are, we create suffering.

As Ram Dass would say, Be Here Now.

I think that is why I am so passionate about the message that knowing your Human Design means nothing if you don’t actually experiment and integrate what you discover. It’s why theHuman Design Map + Portalis abundant with resources to help you both learn AND embody.

Embodiment is where the magic happens! Every single time.

With each method of escape that I’ve let go of, that knowing only gets stronger and stronger.  And not just about Human Design – about everything.

Life really is happeningin the body.

I’m no longer blind to my urges to escape my body. I can see them clearly.

And when I am present with those urges, I know how to show up for myself. It’s a capacity that I have built over time. It didn’t happen overnight.

(I teach the “how” of that in theHuman Design Map)

As my capacity for being present in my body has grown, so has my success, my authenticity, my expression, my intuition, and my contribution. The body is where all of that wisdom lives.

Most recently, I’m focusing on being with physical pain and symptoms. To let them be instead of trying to fix them. Do what I can and let the rest be what it is.

To be fully human, it only works that way.

But if you are like me and you’ve experienced a metric fuck ton of trauma and escaping your body has been your only hope at survival, you can’t expect to just stop it all overnight. You just have to have compassion (human design gate 36), forgiveness (human design gate 4), and give yourself heaps and heaps of grace (human design gate 22).

It takes time to become present in your body.

But when you do, magic really does await because your body holds the wisdom.

### The Positive and Negative Sides of Human Design Gate 47

All energy in theHuman Design chart exists on a spectrum of potential.

On the “positive” end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 47 is the energy for trusting in the divine timing of a-ha moments, insights, and clarity. Gate 47 knows that you are not your mind, thoughts, or stories; you are pure consciousness.

With this knowing, Gate 47 lets thoughts come and go as if they were clouds floating through the sky. And, more importantly, gate 47 doesn’t chase a-ha moments; it makes plenty of space for clarity to come in Divine Timing.

On the “negative” end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 47 is the energy for obsessing about your thoughts and attaching meaning to them. When gate 47 becomes attached to thoughts or “finding” the a-ha moment, it can feel hopeless and a lot of unnecessary mental anguish.

### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 47 (Gene Key 47)

In my early thirties, I heard two axioms that changed the trajectory of my life…

Your thoughts create your reality.

AND

You are not your thoughts.

With my defined head and ajna, these ideas were nothing short of a holy revelation; they were indeed an a-ha moment.

For most of my life, I was very identified with my thoughts. I didn’t understand the sentences, stories, and conclusions inside my head were more like leaves on my river rather than being the river itself. And I had no idea that I had any sort of power over my thinking, either.

And true to mytranspersonal karma, learning that my thoughts and interpretations were “choices” set me onto a whole new path. And it is something that I will be forever grateful for.

The revelation of free-will is nothing short of miraculous.

But, I quickly learned that, in practice, there is a little more to it than “change  your thoughts to change your life.”

As with any axiom, cliche, or widely accepted piece of “wisdom” there is always a kernel of “truth.” But truth is subjective. And when we turn cliches into objective reality, and ignore the need for context, nuance, and empathy, things can quickly go south.

Without comprehension, on a very human level, axioms become impossible standards and measuring sticks of worthiness. They go from being empowering tools to being weapons that we use against ourselves and others.

That is exactly what happened to me when I sunk all of my energy into believing that my thoughts create my reality.

Yes, there was some truth for me there. But mostly, it was an inner war that I could never win. I commonly gaslighted myself (and probably others) into believing that things were great when they absolutely were not. I started to hate myself for having certain thoughts and I perpetuated the very same traumatic patterns that I was trying to heal.

I became insatiable on the quest for the rush of dopamine that came with the newest a-ha moment. A shift in a single thought could put me on a high for days.

And then, the inevitable crash.

Because I am human, my thoughts would seemingly “change back” and I’d be back to square one. But this time, with an all new layer of shame because “I knew better,”

In hindsight, and with my awareness of my Human Design, I can see a few things playing out here.

First, with my undefined solar plexus, I think I was actually unconsciously amplifying the emotional wave of people who had also become obsessed with “thought work.”

Probably more importantly, I was using those tools as a way to keep up in a neurotypical Generator world. I’d “change my thoughts” about feeling exhausted and I’d force myself to do things that I thought I “should” do.

Thankfully, by the mystery of Grace (human design gate 22), I started to recognize that changing my thoughts as a way of bypassing my emotions, glossing over trauma imprints, and ignoring my inner wisdom was causing way more harm than good.

And that by making space to just be with myself and trusting the alchemical process (which I teach inside theHuman Design Map), the a-ha moment really does always just come when we give it space.

By leaning into our inner wisdom and making space to energetically breathe, our perspective naturally changes. And it doesn’t mean that noticing where our thinking is creating harm isn’t a useful thing. Getting clear about the difference between facts and thoughts will forever be a mainstay in my toolbox.

But trying to force things ain’t it. Curiosity (human design gate 61), compassion (human design gate 36), and forgiveness (human design gate 4) are the true MVP’s here.

Using your Human Design to create affirmations is a powerful way to activate the full potential of your chart. Here are some affirmations for Gate 47:

### The Positive and Negative Sides of Human Design Gate48

All energy in theHuman Design chart exists on a spectrum of potential.

On the “positive” end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 48 is the energy for discovering the hidden layers and realms of what it means to be human. Gate 48 understands that you don’t become wise through education. You become wise through embodiment. With this understanding, it is empowered to explore the depths of life with curiosity and humility.

On the “negative” end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 48 is the energy for pursuing knowledge and education as a way to buffer from emotions. It can lead to over-preparing, overplanning, and feeling inadequate in what you know. At its worst, it can abuse positions of power where others are looking to you for depth of wisdom.

### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 48 (Gene Key 48)

As I mentioned in my post abouthuman design gate 18, Gate 48 is defined in my conscious Pluto, which is conjunct with my conscious sun (human design gate 57).

I actually have the full channel of the wavelength (48-16) because gate 16 is defined in my conscious moon.

(I deep dive on all 36 channels inside theHuman Design Mapportal.)

## But before I get too deep on my experience with gate 48, let’s talk about general mechanics and how I interpret them…

### Pluto, Conscious Sun, Conjunction

Pluto is the place where we go through repeated rebirth in our lives – a place where our ego will die, again and again. Pluto takes us into the deepest shadows of our psyche and brings us out the other side with a new sense of integrity and wholeness.

In astrology, a conjunction is when two placements are in the same sign. There is some debate about how many degrees create a true conjunction – the most rigid definition being 10°.

When Pluto is conjunct with the sun, it brings a whole new level of intensity to the (astrology) chart because it “blends” with the life’s work of the conscious sun.

Because of the size of the sun and the density of its neutrino, the conscious sun is 70% of our energy.Everythinghappening in the chart is in service to the full expression of the conscious sun.

And conjunct Pluto, one would expect the full expression of their sun to include lots of (ego) death and rebirth. Pluto people, as they are often called, are alchemists to the core.

### Defined Channels

Defined channels are when both gates of a channel are defined.

When a channel is defined, we tend to have an easier time balancing the energies on each side of the channel and embody afuller spectrumfor them.

They correspond to the pathways in the Kabbalah Tree of Life.

### Kabbalah and Human Design

Kabbalah, Qabalah, and Cabalah are all based on the Tree of Life and I use them interchangeably to honor the various paths.

Kabbalah is the original system from the Jewish tradition, Qabalah is the Western Esoteric (aka Hermetic) path often called Ceremonial Magick or High Magick, and the Cabbala is a christian mystic path. Both Qabalah and Cabbala are rooted in Kabbalah.

All of these are spiritual paths that lead to what is called Enlightenment, Moksha, Self-Realization, a United Will, Completing The Great Work, Oneness, I AM Consciousness, Crystalline Consciousness, Christ Consciousness, and likely many others that I am either forgetting or just not aware of.

Kabbalah is one of the main systems that Human Design pulls from. In particular, there is correspondence between the 36 channels of the HD chart and the 32 pathways in the Tree of Life.

Which, I interpret that to mean that when we surrender to the voice of our magnetic monopole, we too are on the same path to enlightenment.

## Back to my gate 48…

My conscious sun (57), conjunct my conscious Pluto (48), and having the full 48-16 defined has been an interesting thing for me to contemplate. Particularly when I consider my experience of both learning and teaching

Other than the High Magick (which “works” the Kabbalah Tree of Life) and Alchemical Magick, Human Design is the only system that has held my interest enough to go really deep.

And, quite honestly, had it not been for my study of High Magick and Alchemy, I don’t think Human Design would have captured my heart the way it has.

In fact, I heard of Human Design about a decade before I looked more deeply into it. At that time in my life, I didn’t quite understand the value of “waiting” for anything.

But, after years of studing energy healing, magick, and Qabalah + a metric fuck ton of magickal synchronicities, I found my way back to Human Design.

The connection between the flow of the bodygraph and the Kabbalah (Qabalah) Tree of Life hit me like a lightning bolt. I saw the Human Design Chart in a whole new way.

Because of my understanding of the 32 paths of Qabalah, I thought, yep, that is how energy flows in the energy body.

As I started to study Human Design, I saw how truly practical it is when it is broken down into understandable parts. It was like it made Kabbalistic pathworking more “workable.”  And perspective has flowed into how I approach theHuman Design Map, too.

True to my pluto (48) conjunct sun (57), as I’ve gotten deeper and deeper into the Qabalah and Human Design, I’ve been able to step more into trusting my intuition and having many rebirths regarding my natural depth.

I long had a story that I was “too deep.” Making friends was a lifelong challenge because most people think I am “too intense.”

I often joke that if we aren’t talking about God within 5 minutes of meeting, we cannot be friends.

With Human Design in particular, I most recently realized that I had been holding back my depth of knowledge. I bought into the story that what I put out into the world needed to be easy to consume and that I needed to turn the dial down on my firehose.

But, of course, it is actually my depth that the people I am here to serve actually love. They don’t want me to hold back and stay on the surface. They want me to take it out as far into the ether as possible. And, of course, bring it back down for some practical know-how, when necessary.

Whether it is the conversations that happen inside themapportal or the deep dive series on my blog, it is the very thing that people love so much.

It is kind of funny now. I mean, seriously, Human Design is deep as fuck. I truly believe you could spend lifetimes studying it and experimenting with it and still only scratching the surface.

I’m not sure why I thought I needed to hold back. Human Design is the perfect place to “channel” that 48-16 energy.

Duh.

### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 49 (Gene Key 49)

Gate 49 (line 5) is in my unconscious moon, and…it’s been a journey. ;)

Our moon placements reveal how we relate to ourselves, our emotions, our intuition, and our inner wisdom.

The unconscious (red) side of the chart is symbolic of the parts of ourselves that we become conscious of over the course of our life. And often, they are the parts that we hide, reject, or banish in an attempt to be accepted by others (akashadow parts).

Besides the metric fuck ton of energy it takes to keep these parts of ourselves hidden (from ourselves), our shadows are actually the energies we need to leverage in order to have a full expression on the conscious (black) side of the chart.

In other words, if we maintain a “low” frequency on the unconscious side, the same will be true on the conscious side.

And despite what you’ve been told about your shadows, the answer isn’t to get rid of those parts; it is to love, value, and embrace them as essential parts of your higher purpose.

This is precisely what I’ve been doing with gate 49 in my unconscious moon.

(I’ll teach you “how” to love, value, and embrace your shadows inside the Human Design Map Portal.)

Some of the shadow words that could describe gate 49 are stubborn, intolerant, and rebellious. It is often referred to as “the murderer” or “the butcher” because it has a sharp knife and isn’t afraid to use it.

By doing my own shadow integration work, I have no shame in saying that I’ve been known to cut people out of my life due to my intolerance of their so-called imperfections. And I’ve ruthlessly burned bridges more times than I can count.

About a decade ago, I even concluded that my “toxic trait” was running when relationships got hard. It became a weapon I used against myself and a way to stay stuck in my “not good enough” story.

Somewhere along the way, I was conditioned to believe that a “truly healed person” would stay, no matter what. And with every relationship I ended, I hated myself more and more.

I thought that to grow and be an “evolved” person, I needed to learn how to stay, even when I was treated like hot garbage. I believed my role was to be a one-way emotional dumping ground. And that I should take it when people are utterly incapable ofowning their projections.

And “God” knows I tried. But I would inevitably reach my breaking point, and my spleen would scream a fiery NO.

Things came to a head when I spontaneously ended two significant relationships in less than a year.

The first was long overdue. It had always felt tough to stand up for myself and be clear about myboundaries. But on that fated day, I knew that it was time to end things for my emotional, mental, and spiritual well-being.

The second hit harder because it happened very suddenly. It turned out that they weren’t being authentic in our relationship. And hadn’t been for some time. I was hard on myself about not seeing through their inauthenticity; it opened old wounds around self-trust. And I felt ashamed that it was “yet another” relationship I no longer wanted to be in.

As I contemplated gate 49 in my unconscious moon, though, I realized that the problem wasn’t that I “always ran” when things got hard in a relationship.

The problem was that I was hard on myself for having boundaries, clear needs, and a spleen with no fucks left to give.

And while that energy was often expressed through stubbornness, intolerance, and rebellion, at the end of the day, it was me standing up for myself and my principles. I’m leading a personal revolution of authenticity, which can be messy AF.

(Which is why I offer the tools and support I do inside theHuman Design Map & Portal!)

And here is the key:

When I don’t…

…stand up for myself

…honor my boundaries

…show up authentically

I lose the connection I have with myself. My emotions get the best of me because I’m ignoring them. My intuitive spleen must ROAR because I’m not heeding the whispers.

By loving and owning this energy, my “running” instinct becomes a signal that something is off in my inner world. When I want to cut a bitch, it lets me know that I have needs, values, and boundaries that need tending.

With that awareness, I can take a step back, tune in, and see what is most authentic. By doing that, stubbornness, intolerance, and rebellion transform into wisdom, discernment, and revolution.

I’ve let go of the idea that staying in relationships that aren’t healthy is a badge of honor. Staying or going doesn’t prove anything, and I’ve forgiven myself for believing it does.

What I understand now is that being honest with ourselves is what matters most. Because that is the ONLY place we can be honest with others.

You can only stand in your Truth – about your needs, values, and boundaries – if you know your Truth.

That kind of self-leadership will lead to a revolution of authenticity in our relationships.

And I’m glad to be doing my part. Even if it looks like a hot fucking mess sometimes.

If you want to join me in the revolution by becoming a master at transforming your shadows into light,that is precisely what we’ll do inside the Human Design Map + Portal. I’ll see you there.

### The Positive and Negative Sides of Human Design Gate 50

All energy in theHuman Design chart exists on a spectrum of potential.

On the “positive” end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 50 is the energy for harmonizing the vibration of a group to a frequency that is rooted in the values and beliefs that will serve everyone. Gate 50 has an instinctive knowing that groups are only as healthy as each member and can easily spot fears that “corrupt” a group. With this awareness, it is able to determine the values that will serve it, the community and the collective.

On the “negative” end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 50 is the energy for staying in groups even though you can sense their “corrupt” nature. It may live out of fear, anger, and poor boundaries and is be easily persuaded into incorrect values and beliefs by unhealthy groups. This ultimately can lead to burnout and confusion.

You’ll learn about the surprising (but most effective) way to raise your energy frequency in theHuman Design Map + Portal.

In the meantime, start noticing when you are feeling unaccountable, like a people pleaser or coward but don’t be an asshole to yourself. Treat yourself the way you would a small child – with love, curiosity, and understanding.

### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 50 (Gene Key 50)

Gate 50 is undefined in my chart but it does hold a special place in my heart.

The firstHuman Design MapI ever made was for someone with gate 50 in theirincarnation cross. I wrote about what a profound experience that was in my post ongate 15.

But, that aside, gate 50 has played a pretty significant role in my life because my conscious south node is also defined by its harmonic gate,human design gate 27.

Since I have passed my Uranus Opposition, I have shifted intogate 28being my nodal “petri dish.” (I explain the petri dish concept in my post ongate 48).

But, for most of my life, I have been deeply challenged in finding the balance between my needs and the needs of others.

There are lots of places in my chart that can point to that, havingtranspersonal karmabeing the main one. But, the chart aside, I think most women, especially of my age, were conditioned to sacrifice themselves for the sake of others.

So, whether it all comes down to gate 27 in my south node, I can’t say for sure.

What I can say, though, is that the thing that shifted my energy in gate 27 was knowing my values and aligning myself with them.

Inside theHuman Design Mapportal, I have a guide on defining your values. If you are amapclient, you can find thathere.

Some of my top values are integrity, intention, and clarity. With a mix of individual and collectivecircuitry, I also value individual and collective empowerment.

And nowhere in those values do I put myself at the bottom of the list. More importantly, I don’t surround myself with people who expect that from me.

I no longer believe that I was put on this earth to please others.

I started surrounding myself with people who understood that you can’t get water out of a dry well. I stopped being attached to what certain groups of people thought about me. And I let go of the idea that my value as a human being came from what I could do for others.

I can’t say that I always get the balance right. As I said before, I am a 5/2 profile which meansmy karma is transpersonal. So, on some level, I will always be balancing my need to serve others with my need to go within and be in my own flow. And deconditioning is about practice, not perfection.

(You’ll learn about your profile and karma in theHuman Design Map.)

But, for the most part, I do understand that honoring my needs + values and giving from the overflow is the way to go. And, I practice letting the chips fall where they may – by letting others think whatever they want about me.

And, I am starting to see that, as a karmic mirror for others (5/2), doing what is best for me and in alignment with my values is a powerful mirror to hold up.

When you stand in the truth that the gifts of gate 50 are always available to you (whether it’s defined in your chart or not)…

What do you value? (not sure? There is a bonus worksheet in theHuman Design Mapto walk you through defining your values.)

What do your values look like in action?

On a scale from 1 to 4, do you honor your values each day? 1 is not honoring your values at all and 4 is absolutely putting your values first.

How might the people you surround yourself with be influencing the way you show up for your values? Do you want to keep it that way? Or change it?

### The Positive and Negative Sides of Human Design Gate 51

All energy in theHuman Design chart exists on a spectrum of potential.

On the “positive” end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 51 is the energy for Initiating awakening through the shock of unconditional love. In its highest frequency, gate 51 believes life is trustworthybecause ofit’s curveballs (rather than in spite of them) and practices radical faith that every moment, even the most horrific ones, are gateways into Divine Love.

On the “negative” end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 51 is the energy for using shock to hurt others, pushing people’s buttons, and deeply traumatic life experiences. These are all indicators of losing faith in life/the Divine and ignoring the calls to awaken.

You’ll learn about the surprising (but most effective) way to raise your energy frequency in theHuman Design Map + Portal.

### My Personal Experience with Human Design Gate 51 (Gene Key 51)

I have gate 51 (line 5) in the conscious earth of myincarnation cross.

And to say that I know the energy of Gate 51 really well would be the understatement of the century.

I once had a therapist tell me that people with stories like mine jump off bridges. An astrologer told me that they’d need a stiff drink to read my chart. And an “Intuitive Human Design Expert” told me that I should just call it quits, collect unemployment, and play video games for the rest of my life.

As a child, I witnessed things you wouldn’t wish on your worst enemy. I’ve experienced things no human should have to experience. And I often feel like I’ve lived hundreds of lifetimes in this one incarnation.

I could truly go on for days about the various shocks I’ve experienced. That isn’t to say that I’ve had a “worse” life than anyone else. I don’t really find those types of judgments useful.

But, I do share it to demonstrate that working WITH the energy we actually have, instead of using it against ourselves, is the greatest contribution we can make to the world.

It took me many, many years to understand that, and it is what I teach myHuman Design Mapclients every single day.

For the first part of my life, I didn’t know how to deal with the shock and trauma. And, like so many in my generation, no one helped me process my experiences in a healthy way, and I was often dismissed as being “too sensitive” or “dramatic.”

By high school, I had developed an eating disorder, and by my mid-twenties I was strung out on drugs.

The pain was too much to bear.

That began to change during my first Saturn Return.

One of my brothers, Ronnie, died in a car accident at the age of 25. My other brother, Bryan, has since unexpectedly died as well.

Both were powerful spiritual awakenings in my life.

But when Ronnie died, the sheer shock of it cracked me open in a way that I can’t explain.

It is like I finally surrendered to the beautiful disaster of life on Earth.

Suddenly, I had a deep understanding that life will always be full of plot twists and that I can either keep using them against me or for me.

I wouldn’t have said it quite that way at the time. I’m not even sure I would have seen it as such a pivotal time in my life.

But my life was never the same after it.

By my early 30s, I was in much-needed therapy, recovering from the eating disorders, completely sober, in a healthy relationship with my husband, and starting my business.

It was a winding road, of course, and I learned a metric fuck ton along the way.

I went on to become a master energy healer and coach. I developed my signature energy healing method and eventually surrendered to the call to teach others about their Human Design.

(I teach my signature healing method, called the MAP Method for Deconditioning, inside theHuman Design Mapportal.)

As gate 51 shows us, I let the shocks wake me up.

But, of course, awakening is an ongoing process. After we integrate one thing, a new layer is revealed, and that is precisely what happened when I was 36.

I “accidentally” learned that the man I call dad isn’t my biological father.

My parents had kept this secret from me and never intended to tell me the truth. The pain was complex and profound. I felt relieved, angry, hurt, and confused.

The way I experienced the shock was utterly different, though.

It hurt like hell, but I immediately understood it was for my awakening. I knew that I would emerge from it with a more embodied experience of Grace, forgiveness, and gratitude.

True to my design, I was stable and grounded by the shock. I know that sounds like a paradox. But it is 100% true.

It is a paradox because we often believe that shock must equal suffering.

But, like all beliefs, seeing life that way is optional.

I now realize that spiritual awakening requires shock.

Shock cracks our hearts wide open so that we can receive the wealth of unconditional love (gate 25).

Even in our deepest suffering, even in the face of our ugliest shadows, and even when we can’t wrap our minds around whatever is happening.

It is always happeningforus, nottous.

And there is nothing more beautiful than that. When you are ready to have your heart cracked wide open, purchase yourHuman Design Mapand then take the journey in the portal. Let it shock you.

### The Positive and Negative Sides of Human Design Gate 52

All energy in theHuman Design chart exists on a spectrum of potential.

On the “positive” end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 52 is the energy for having faith in divine timing and trusting yourself to act when the time is right. Gate 52 believes that patience really is a virtue and it understands that there is a time and season for everything. With this mindset, it can sit still, concentrate on the things that capture its interest, and trust in the right timing.

On the “negative” end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 52 is the energy for staying still when it’s time to move and moving when it’s time to stay still. It can also try to force things to work according to its mind’s timing rather than trusting in Divine timing, which can lead to things not working as the mind hopes.

### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 52 (Gene Key 52)

Gate 52 is in the root center, a pressure center and home to the adrenal glands. The bodygraph has two pressure centers: the head and the root.

Simply put, the head center creates the pressure to think by asking big questions, and the root center creates pressure to take or guide the actions that evolve humanity. The gates that are pressured to take action are Gate 52,Gate 60, andGate 53. The gates that are pressured to guide action areGate 58,Gate 38,Gate 54,Gate 19,Gate 39, andGate 41.​In traditional Human Design, the pressure of the root center is often described as a pulse; it turns on and off mysteriously – it cannot be predicted or controlled. This uncontrollable pulse is often called Divine Timing.

In the case of the 52, since it is part of a generated channel and is also a format channel, the pressure is to take action in Divine Timing. Divine timing is an essential part of how humans evolve—it is literally one of the formats of the changes and transformations that humanity will go through.

(If you are aHuman Design Map & Portalcustomer, you can find more information on format channels in the Channels course in your portal dashboard. My team and I would love to answer any questions you have in the discussions there.)

While I have a defined head center, and am all too familiar with the pressure the head creates, my root center is undefined. And, without a doubt, I can say that any wisdom I have about root pressure is hard-won. True to my root being undefined, so much of my life has been about trying to escape pressure and stress by taking action.

And, as they say, the body keeps the score. I’ve completely burnt out my adrenals a couple of times and have pulled myself off the brink of it more times than I can count.

On the other hand, my husband has channel 9-52 defined, and therefore, a defined root center.

And while it is natural and easy for me to regulate the pressure in the head, he is a true natural at the pressure of the root.

He works in a high-pressure job with constant deadlines and it takes A LOT to stress him out. If he is stressed, you know some shit is going down.

What I’ve noticed about him that is so different from me is his pace in general. His energy is very “steady mountain” and he rarely, if ever, rushes. He has his own inner sense of timing that seems to work for him.

Even when I LOUDLY roll my eyes, he won’t hurry out the door. It is like he doesn’t even know how. In contrast, you will find me rushing, rushing, rushing to get to the next thing; I have to consciously slow myself down.

For example, when we go to Target, he is always many steps behind me, and it’s easy for me to lose him. I speed walk like my life depends on getting to the toilet paper aisle the fastest, and he is on a leisurely Sunday stroll.

It’s a constant reminder for me to slow the fuck down.

I don’t always have to take action right now. I don’t have to rush to get toilet paper. I don’t have to live every single minute like I’m on a super-secret mission.

I can slow down. I can trust myself, life, and that thing that some call God.

Life is not as urgent as we often make it out to be. When we lean into Divine Timing, combined with our own inner wisdom, things really do have a way of working themselves.

We don’t have to rush to the next thing, and we don’t even have to pressure ourselves to grow and evolve.

As the bodygraph shows us, that isn’t in our control, and it happens naturally as we lean into our authentic energy.

There really is an ebb and flow to this crazy experience called Life As Human. It is just a matter of choosing which game we want to play. Do we trust the Divine? Or do we try to control the flow? You choose.

If you want to trust Divine Timing and harness the power of your authentic energy, you will love theHuman Design Map & Portal. It will help you understand your design, make authentic decisions, overcome people-pleasing, and believe in the value you bring to the world.Get yours here.

### The Positive and Negative Sides of Human Design Gate 53

All energy in theHuman Design chart exists on a spectrum of potential.

On the “positive” end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 53 is the energy for seeing all of life as an opportunity to grow. To gate 53, all of life holds infinite potential for evolution and growth. It trusts that when you begin new things based on the guidance of your inner wisdom, magick swoops in to help you see it through to the end.

On the “negative” end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 53 is the energy for having too many open loops (projects, goals, ideas, tasks) and no energy to see them through. It can lead to always staying in your comfort zone and quitting too soon. If fear is running the show, it can also contribute to excessive spending or beginning things out of scarcity.

### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 53 (Gene Key 53)

Gate 53, line 6, is defined in my unconscious Mercury.

I am quite obsessed with Mercury and his role in our Human Design chart.

Mercury, in Greek mythology, was Hermes. He was the God of travel, translation, commerce, financial gain, wealth, and communication. He loaded up his cart and brought valuable gifts to the people in the village.The distance between the conscious (personality) and unconscious (design) sides of the chart is 88°, the exact time it takes Mercury to make a complete orbit (aka all 64Human Design gates) around the sun.

This, to me, means that Mercury infused ourincarnation cross(aka purpose) with everything we could possibly need to bring our cart of highly valuable gifts to the metaphorical market.

Our Mercury placement specifically tells us what we communicate to the world when we show up to be seen by others.

If you are one of myHuman Design Mapclients and have checked out the quick and dirty business guide in the portal, you already know that our Mercury isn’t something we conjure or need to “try” to communicate.You’ve heard the adage that energy doesn’t lie. Humans can sense the frequency we vibrate no matter what we say or do. That’s Mercury.

The value we bring to others is the frequency of our Mercury placement. And it can’t be faked.

To take this even further, if the conscious side Mercury is what we communicate (no matter what we are doing), our unconscious Mercury is the primary “block” that prevents expansion into higher frequencies on the conscious side.

So, if we communicate a “low vibe,” a shadow on the unconscious side of the chart needs integration.

To be clear, “low vibe” is not a moral judgment, even though new-age rhetoric often turns it into one. That is why I put it in quotes.Every single human being on the planet is a mix of shadow (unconscious) and light (conscious). Our consciousness expands by bringing our shadows (unconscious parts) into the light (conscious awareness).

In other words, shadow integration is “how” we come to know our Divinity. The great spiritual masters – Jesus, Buddha, Krishna, etc. – showed us what that looks like.

When it comes to what our lives say to the world, our unconscious Mercury gate is the primaryshadowthat “blocks” higher-frequency communication.

For me, that “block” is gate 53, the Spark of Alchemy.

I havegate 46, line 6, in my conscious mercury. This means that — no matter what I am doing — I  communicate about the magick of synchronicity, the embodiment of bhakti, and the love of being alive in a human body.

That is probably why I strongly advocate for knowing your human design AND using it as a doorway into self-discovery, experimentation, and intentional living. It’s why I offer so much follow-up support and additional resources with theHuman Design Map & Portal.

I know that experimenting leads to the embodiment of the soul; it is how we can revel in being alive. And fall madly in love with who we truly are. That magick has absolutely nothing to do with information.

Without experimenting, Human Design falls 100% flat.

When I first started sharing about Human Design though, I was holding back a lot.

I came into Human Design with a background in energy healing, alchemy, High Magick, and Western Kabbalahistic pathworking.

And I saw how others had their names dragged through the mud when they had even a tiny deviation from “source material” in theirinterpretation of Human Design.

True to gate 53 in my unconscious Mercury, integrating magick and alchemy into my work with Human Design felt terrifying.

But as I worked through my fears and brought those parts to the metaphorical village, I could see that magick, alchemy, and understanding how transformation actually works are essential for me to communicate about embodiment.

It isn’t optional. It is what draws people to me.

And I don’t just mean to teach it. I do. The entireMAPMethod for Deconditioning inside theHuman Design Map & Portalis based on the seven phases of spiritual alchemy.

I mean, I must live it, too.

If I’m not doing my inner healing work to decondition the shit that gets in the way of my authentic embodiment, that will be loud and clear.

If I am not making choices aligned with my inner wisdom, that is the message that will come across.

If I am choosing people pleasing over authenticity, that is the vibe people will pick up.

No matter what I say.

And here is what I know for sure about embodiment and alchemy:

You can only heal what you can see.

Our intention to live in alignment with the highest potential of our purpose is the beginning. It is the match that lights the fires of our seeing. It is thespark of alchemy.

Your intention is like a message to your soul that says:

Please show me all the “reasons” why I don’t do what I say I want to do. Make it so fucking clear that I can’t deny it anymore. Write it so big and bold that I can get out of my way.

And, uh, that shit is messy.

But, the bullshit new age rhetoric often tells us that all we have to do is put some shit on a vision board, and it will manifest into reality.

So, you expect rainbows, butterflies, and pop culture magic. And when it doesn’t go like that, you will give up and fall into a hole of shame. You will think you are broken and not worthy of your heartfelt desires.

Ask me how I know.

Because I have fallen into those same traps, afraid of how others will see me, I’ve held back and pretended not to be the force of nature I AM.

Those traps are a firehose on the spark.

The promise of alchemy allows us to be seen in our fullness, our wholeness, and our true magick.

But it isn’t supposed to go perfectly. Becoming a person of high-frequency purpose and contribution doesn’t bypass your humanity.

It is your doorway into it.

And when you expect (and celebrate) the shit to hit the fan instead of a fairy tale, you can navigate it with Grace instead of self-hatred.

You can meet the parts of yourself that are terrified of being seen and create the love, belonging, and safety they need to shine. You can be the very love that you crave.

That alchemy is where the potential for embodied purpose lives.

I would even be so bold as to say that your intentions are inevitable when you know how to navigate the natural flow of alchemy.

(You’ll learn “how” in theHuman Design Map & Portal.)

At the end of the day, I can’t approach Human Design without bringing all of that in. Mercury won’t let me.

Because it would mean denying authentic parts of myself, which would defeat the purpose entirely.

Today, I am boldly vocal and upfront about my alchemical approach to Human Design. When you come into my world, I will not pretend that knowing this or that about your design is the secret sauce. And I will not hide the necessity of inner healing work from you.

No matter whichhuman design gatesare in yourincarnation crossor mercury gates, expanding your consciousness and making your most valuable contribution in the world requires the spark of alchemy.

You literally can’t have one without the other. Mercury will be sure of that. If you want to master the inner alchemy required to overcome people-pleasing and embody the highest frequency of your purpose, you will love theHuman Design Map & Portal. I made it just for people who know that human design information is not the magick. Showing up, getting out of your own way, and learning how to make authentic decisions is.Get yours here.

### The Positive and Negative Sides of Human Design Gate 54

All energy in theHuman Design chart exists on a spectrum of potential.

On the “positive” end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 54 is the energy for ambition and drive. And because the 54 has a deep inner knowing that all paths lead to the Divine, it is empowered to master the material plane (time, money, resources) as a path to spiritual growth.

On the “negative” end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 54 is the energy for having blind ambition that takes you nowhere and leaves you feeling bitter. The 54 can be prone to giving up too quickly when results aren’t instant.

You’ll learn about the surprising (but most effective) way to raise your energy frequency in theHuman Design Map + Portal.

In the meantime, start noticing when you are feeling passive, obsessed or self-absorbed but don’t be an asshole to yourself. Treat yourself the way you would a small child – with love, curiosity, and understanding.

### My Personal Experience with Human Design Gate 54 (Gene Key 54)

I must tell you that gate 54 holds a near and dear place in my heart.

Technically, Gate 54 isundefinedin my bodygraph. But, when you look at my astrological chart through the lens of theHuman Design gates, it is the gate in my Midheaven.

In astrology, our Midheaven holds important clues about our career, reputation, and the legacy that we will leave in the world.

As a Projector, I am hardwired to crave wild success – the kind that blows your mind with possibility. And I’m also a contemplative mystic.

Myincarnation cross,the Left Angle Cross of the Clarion 2 (57/51, 62/61) speaks to my life’s work and purpose being of a spiritual nature.

(I’ll explain how the four gates of your incarnation cross work together inside yourHuman Design Map.)

As long as I can remember, I’ve been deeply connected to the unseen realms. It has always been clear to me that pulling a thread over here impacts the one over there. And, of course, I am deeply fascinated by the golden thread that some call God.

Like many mystics before me, I’ve understood that we didn’t incarnate on earth to “be spiritual” or to “transcend” the human experience. And that “God” isn’t the angry, vengeful, codependent beast that many find in the Bible.

We are incarnated tobeHuman. To play hide and seek with our Divinity in the game called life.

AsRam Dasswould say,being here nowis the whole point.

In the east, they have a concept about householders versus renunciants, and have the wisdom to understand that most of us are incarnate to be householders. Meaning, we are “meant” to have mouths to feed, bills to pay, a body to keep safe, and a life immersed in “the real world.”

And while giving up those “worldly” needs may be just the right thing for some, for most of us, we don’t need to give up living in the real world to be “worthy” in the eyes of “God.”

First of all, because worthiness is not real; it’s a made up construct by the ego. But, somewhere along the way, I bought into the lie that “spiritual people” shouldn’t have earthbound ambitions.

And, long before theHuman Design Mapbecame a thing, or I knew anything about astrology, being in business showed me that an important part of my spiritual path is material mastery.

In the beginning, I was shocked to discover that “wanting to help people” doesn’t make my grocery bill or mortgage disappear. And running a business requires so much more than offering value to other people. (Want unbelievable value?Get your map here!)

In addition to providing goods or services, running a business requires “real world” skills like sales, marketing, administration, managing people, delegation, wise decision making, and a deep grasp on the cold, hard numbers.

The reality is that if you keep your head in the sand about all that, you will quickly be applying for a j-o-b.

And let’s be honest: I’m unemployable with my sassy mouth. 🤣

As all of that started to sink in, I saw that to create true success and prosperity, Icouldn’tchoose between my spiritual life and my worldly ambition. It had to be both.

I started to wonder if maybe my wild success would come when I used my desire for prosperity and material mastery as the way to grow and expand my definition of “God.”

That perhaps success wouldn’t happen in spite of being a contemplative mystic butbecause of it.

Maybe, just maybe, my business could become a playground where I faced myself in the deepest of ways. Becoming seen, recognized, and highly valued would be the ultimate invitation toconfront my stories, process my emotions, and face my shadows.

(You will learn those skills inside theHuman Design Mapportal!)

Come to find out…All those people who say that you have to choose between success and spiritual devotion are wrong (for me).

Surrendering to the mastery of business without sacrificing my body, mind, or spirit has led me to levels of spiritual growth that I could have never imagined.  And the more success I see in my business, the more and more true that becomes.

I’ve come to understand – and what I hope my legacy will be – is that mastering the material plane is a beautiful path to spiritual expansion and growth.

Your definition of that thing that some call God can actually become BIGGER when you embrace your ambitious parts. And, I for one, am so grateful to have come to this understanding.

Today, my business is a wild success and keeps growing.

TheHuman Design Maphas blown my mind repeatedly with possibilities. It is filled to the brim with a community of people who are healed by my words and transformed by the alchemical tools that I teach them to wield.

And, more and more, I soften into the knowing that there is no need to sacrifice what is true for me, as a human being, along the way. The more I lean into what is true for me, the more successful I become.

I easily provide for our financial needs, give to causes I deeply care about, and am devoted to my spiritual path. I am connected to my higher purpose and becoming clearer about what that means with each passing day.

And hey, if that is what I become known for in this world, I’m perfectly OK with that. Here’s to both/and.

## Affirmations for Human Design Gate 54

Using your Human Design to create affirmations is a powerful way to activate the full potential of your chart. Here are some affirmations for Gate 54:

What is your relationship with ambition, material mastery, and spiritual growth in your life?

### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 55 (Gene Key 55)

One of my favorite people on the planet,Leah Badertscher, has gate 55 in her conscious sun.

She has been a long-time friend and was one of my clients when I did private coaching. She was even one of the first to get aHuman Design Map.

And though she was my client, she taught me so much about what faith in abundance actuallyfeelslike.

Through her, the concept of abundance moved from being theoretical to something tangible I could experience in my body. In witnessing her, I saw what abundance looks like in human form.

She has this tenacious AF spirit that is like riding on a wing and a prayer.

She has shown me that faith is everything. And not religious faith.

Sure, that may be the path for some. But as we head into the 2027 transition, cultivating faith in the Divine that dwells within is how we will thrive.

Faith in your own spirit. Faith that if you can dream it, it is already yours. Faith that life is a table and we are here to feast.

What has become clear to me is that faith doesn’t look like sitting around and hoping for some mystical savior to come along.

Yes, there are guides in both the natural and spirit realms.

But those guides are always a mirror of your own inner wisdom. YOU are the guru.

And faith is showing up and working with what you’ve got.

It’s Creative, with a capital C, as Leah says, and it is about cultivating an intentional relationship with the part of you that already knows and trusts in the abundance of life.

Faith is trusting that when you ask, it is given.

Faith knows that we aren’t given dreams as a torture tactic – they are for our becoming.

The things we most desire out of life are catalysts for knowing our spiritual essence and aligning with our higher purpose.

(This is one of the bazillion reasons I love Human Design. It gives context to the things we’ve always wanted and is the clearestmap for aligning with your higher purpose.)

Faith is allowing the spirit to dance through your every move. It is surrendering to the whole experience of being human.

It is being here now, feeling it all the way through, and finding the abundance in all of it.

## Affirmations for Human Design Gate 55

Using your Human Design to create affirmations is a powerful way to activate the full potential of your chart. Here are some affirmations for Gate 55:

### The Positive and Negative Sides of Human Design Gate 56

All energy in theHuman Design chart exists on a spectrum of potential.

On the “positive” end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 56 is the energy for telling stories from its many adventures. Gate 56 finds humor, amusement, and delight in all things, even in places others might consider to be dark or cold. It has an inner knowing when it is time to step outside of its comfort zone and when it’s time to tell a better story about life.

On the “negative” end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 56 is the energy for becoming easily distracted with shiny object syndrome, overstimulation, or boredom from insufficient stimulation. It can easily slip into playing the role of victim in life and or being unable to let go of outdated mental stories because it is emotionally attached to them.

You’ll learn about the surprising (but most effective) way to raise your energy frequency in theHuman Design Map + Portal.

The most important thing to raise the frequency of gate 56 is to foster great stories with travel, play, and enriching environments.

### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 56 (Gene Key 56)

Gate 56.3 is defined, in detriment, in my unconscious Venus. Let me break the mechanics of that down a bit:

Venus shows us where we find beauty in life, literally and metaphorically.It connects us to our values, deepens our relationships, and creates a sense of awe, wonder, and majesty.

The unconscious placements in our chart show us the main “blocks” andrejected shadow partsthat prevent flow on the conscious side.

The third line is about making mistakes, trial and error, and a deep willingness to figure things out.

A placement in detriment shows us where we will tend to “default” tothe “low” frequency spectrumof any given energy and where we have a lot of potential for rewriting ourkarma.

(If you are aHuman Design Map & Portalcustomer, check out the “quick and dirty guide” on Gate Nuances inside your portal.)

And, holy shit, this potent combination of mechanics (Gate 56.3, in detriment, in my unconscious Venus) could not be more true for me.

My conscious Venus isHuman Design Gate 43– which is all about tuning in to the inner voice to create breakthroughs.

One of the most stunning things about life is the breakthrough that happens when we are deeply attuned to our inner wisdom.

Of course, part of this is myHuman Design Gate 57(my conscious sun/purpose) talking because we can only trust our intuition when we create the space and willingness to listen to it.

But I have endless stories (no pun intended!) of witnessing breakthroughs happen with others as a direct result of them going inside themselves. Watching these moments unfold brings tears to my eyes. The beauty of it astounds me (Venus).

(This is why I love Human Design so much. It gives usa mapfor that kind of exploration.)

When it comes to my own breakthroughs and opening up to the beauty within them, though, I have to be mindful of the stories I am telling myself. I am no stranger to making the stuff of life mean horrendous things.

(We all do that sometimes!)

When I am caught in one of those shitty stories, I shut down. My eyes close so tight that I can’t see the beauty and majesty of what is. My inner wisdom becomes quiet, and a true breakthrough is locked out of my heart and mind.

In those moments, my work is to remember that self-compassion, grace, and opening to possibility are the first steps in telling a new story. We cannot transform our stories when they are steeped in shame, self-ridicule, and victim consciousness.

As I teach in the Art of Remembering (a bonus course in theHuman Design Map & Portal), the practice is remembering to remember.

I remember by connecting with my purpose, the value I bring to the world, and separating the facts from the fiction. In that remembering, a new story is born.

Yes, by the mystery of Grace, shitties stories might be my first instinct. I will get caught in shitty stories again. And, because I am a human being, I will forget my purpose, my value, and that thoughts (stories) are not truth with a capital T.

Stories are choices; they are our free will.

So, I will keep letting go of the old stories, choosing new ones, and allowing myself to see the beauty of this life. I will stand in reverence as my breakthroughs come. And I will remember as many times as it takes.

And so it is.

### The Positive and Negative Sides of Human Design Gate 57

All energy in theHuman Design chart exists on a spectrum of potential.

On the “positive” end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 57 is the energy for trusting your intuitive knowing above all else; it is highly intuitive, clairaudient, and quite possibly psychic. Gate 57 believes that everything you need to know is alive in the present moment and that the body is the most trustworthy source of intuition. The future is bright when you trust yourself.

On the “negative” end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 57 is the energy for not trusting your intuition or writing off your intuitive knowing because there is nothing logical to back it up. This lack of trust can lead to trusting other people’s opinions or overriding intuitive wisdom with logic, reason, and mental rationalization and creating a life that is frustrating, bitter, anger-filled, or disappointing.

In the meantime, start noticing when you are feeling indecisive, intrusive or “too” spontaneous, but don’t be an asshole to yourself. Treat yourself the way you would a small child – with love, curiosity, and understanding.

### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 57 (Gene Key 57)

Gate 57 is defined in the conscious sun of myincarnation cross, which means it is the most important gate in my chart. It is my “Divine Invitation” to trust my intuition and create the kind of life that sets me up for intuitive clarity.

And, well, it has been a journey.

For most of my life, I was on a path of repeatedly ignoring my intuition and regretting it later.

I would get very clear NO signals but I would discount them. My thoughts would convince me that my intuition was illogical and therefore, untrustworthy.

I had disintegratedshadowsaround being weird, crazy, or “too” suspicious. I never wanted others to judge me as odd or strange for my “illogical” decisions.

(You’ll learn the shadows of your design inside theHuman Design Mapand learn how to integrate them inside themapportal.)

That completely shifted when I had a session with a healer who focused on helping others reclaim their intuitive gifts.

I told her about an experience I’d had with a well known business coach.

My colleagues wouldn’t shut up talking about this guy. But when I visited his website,  my whole body said NO and I felt immediately suspicious.

But, in my mind, I believed that because “all the cool kids” were hiring this person, that I should too. I thought that, clearly, my body was wrong and that I should do what everyone else was doing on.

You know what they say about jumping off of bridges?

Well, I jumped. And while I won’t get into all of the details of what went down, I will say that my suspicions were 100% spot the fuck on.

As I was telling the healer that story, she stopped me and she said something that would change my life forever (Human Design Gate 23vibes!).

She said:

“Your suspicion is your intuition.”

My mind was so blown. Literally blown.

I cannot tell you how many times I’d felt suspicious in my life only to be told that I was being too sensitive (Human Design Gate 19) or ungracious (Human Design Gate 22). And, of course, only to realize later that I was right the whole time.

But, because I’d made suspicion wrong in my mind, I ignored it.

After that session with her, though, I started to pay extra close attention to sensations of suspicion, mistrust, and leeriness. If I picked up “bad vibes” at all, I started trusting them more and more.

I would walk away, no questions asked. And if people thought I was weird, strange, odd, crazy, or whatever, they could fuck right off with that noise.

I live by my intuition, not by other people’s thoughts. I embrace my weirdness. ;)

By the time I found Human Design, I was alreadydoing a ton of deconditioningaround my intuition. But, learning my design helped me take it to a whole new level.

(I’ll guide you through deconditioning inside theHuman Design Mapportal and integration course.)

My spleen is heavily defined and, according to Human Design, I have splenic authority.

That means my NO is essential to my safety and wellbeing.

So, now, my focus is all about peeling back all the ways my body says NO to things. Not just sensations like suspicion or “bad vibes” but things that don’t sound, smell, taste, look “right” are also ways my body says NO.

I’d be lying if I said that I trust those signals every time.

But, thankfully, I have compassion and Grace for myself. I know that with gate 57 in my conscious sun, my relationship with my intuition isn’t supposed to be all rainbows and butterflies.

There is “supposed to be” some grit there. And I have surrendered to the knowing that I will be on a lifelong journey of expanding my capacity to trust my intuition.

What I can say, though, with 100% certainty, is that leaning into my intuition more and more has changed the quality of my life in ways I could have never imagined.

I am truly thriving. Life isn’t perfect, of course, because it isn’t supposed to be. Earth is a place of duality.

But, my relationships are thriving. My business is booming. Themapportal conversations I get to have with people, from all over the world, blow my mind.

My body is becoming healthier and healthier.

And, more importantly, that I actually trust myself. I am way less inclined to let my mind overrule my inner knowing and I am deeply embodied in my emotional signature of success.

How does it get better than this?!?!

### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 58 (Gene Key 58)

Let me tell you…

I am no stranger to believing that joy and happiness come from the outside — other people, stuff, food, etc.

At one time in my life, nothing “made me happier” than going to Target, grabbing a latte, and browsing the aisles for the latest and greatest thing.

I complained if people didn’t behave as I thought they should. I huffed, and I puffed. I raged all around me.

When I was unhappy at work, I’d look for a new job. When I was disappointed with my boyfriend, I broke up with him. When I “had nothing to wear,” I’d go buy more clothes.

But, no matter how much stuff I accumulated, how much food I ate, and how many boys liked me, it was never enough.

And I know I’m not alone in that. I see it all the time with my clients inside themapportal, too. Some people even use their Human Design chart as the new thing to blame when things aren’t working out the way they hoped.

To be clear, I don’t say that in a judgmental way. I say it with a deep ache in my heart because I know how painful that state of being is.

Along the way, we get glimmers of what it means to be in our full power; to abide in the kind of joy that can only come from trusting ourselves.

And we want to surrender to voice of our higher self and inner wisdom so fucking bad it hurts. But making the leap into trusting oneself, after decades of making everyone and everything responsible for your happiness, is a form of ego death. The structures that held up our victim consciousness must burn down before we can create a new way of being.

And that is because of two things:

First, Earth is a world of contrast.

We didn’t incarnate to be blissed out all the time. There are rainbows,  butterflies, and maybe even unicorns 😉. But there are also hurricanes, systems of oppression, famine, and war.

We came to expand our consciousness; to play the game of hide and seek with Divine selves. And that expansion comes through the love and acceptance of theshadow.

The contrast of life provides the grit necessary to polish and buff out the karma that keeps you trapped in the illusion of separateness.

On a practical level, that looks like owning your experience and not giving people, your clothes, your bank account, or the cute pillow at target the power to control your inner state of being.

Your thoughts, feelings, and emotions come from how your nervous system interprets the facts of life. And they are compounded by the meaning you make about yourself, the world, and that thing that some call God.

Now, for the love of all things holy, don’t mistake what I mean here.

I’m not saying that if you “just think positive,” you’ll be happy all the time, that you should stay in miserable situations because they are your fault, or that you are to blame for everything you’ve experienced.Blame and responsibility are two different things.

Blame is about looking to the past to find fault; it comes from fighting with reality and the delusion that you can change the past. Blame gives your power away and leaves you powerless.

Responsibility is looking at what is true right now, eyes wide open, and deciding what you’ll do to move forward. Responsibility is where all of your power to live authentically comes from.

The good news is that your brain and nervous system are malleable like clay and you can stop blaming life (or yourself) and you can start choosing new interpretations, expand your capacity for joy, and create new default patterns.

Your Human Design gives you amapfor that journey. And, inside the portal, you’ll learn “how” to expand your capacity for joy by no longer giving your power away and by surrendering to your inner wisdom.Get your map and portal access here.

In the meantime, know this:

Deep joy is available to you.

To experience it, you must start by taking full responsibility for your own well-being. You have to stop giving your power away to the world around you. You must remember that…

…If you need your boss to be a certain way for you to be happy, you’re in for a crapshoot.

…If you buy that cute pillow at Target, once it’s been in your living room for a little while, you aren’t even going to notice it anymore.

…If it’s raining outside, hating the weather does nothing to change it.

But when you recognize that your wellbeing is an inside job and that you have what it takes to be your own hero,  then, and only then do you have a solid foundation for expansive joy.

And it’s delightful. Go on that journey inside theHuman Design Mapportal.

### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 59 (Gene Key 59)

Gate 59 (line 5) is defined in my unconscious mars placement. According to theGene Keys, our unconscious mars is the core wound we carry in our relationships and becomes our vocation as we heal those wounds.

(If you are one of myHuman Design Mapclients and are a business owner, go to the Human Design and Business quick and dirty guide inside the map portal for more information about how vocation relates to marketing! There is a login link at the bottom of this email. )

Understanding the symbolism of the 59 as my core wound was nothing short of a holy revelation.

I have often been called an “oversharer” because I’ve never really been afraid to share intimate details about my life.

I do have lines I don’t cross, of course, but I do tend to be more open, honest, and willing to risk emotional rejection than a lot of people. I’ll answer almost any question people ask and see great value in sharing my authentic experience.

But, holy shit, being an “over-sharer” has created so much freaking pain in my life.

It took me a long time to understand that being “too” vulnerable was such a great source of suffering.

We are so often told that we “should be more vulnerable” and I took that to the max.

But, as Brene so wisely says, we need to be discerning about our vulnerability and that we should only share with those that have earned the right to hear our story.

Perhaps it was my Projector energy that so desperately wanted to be recognized or my undefined will trying to prove something, but I often found myself sharing intimate details and having them fall on deaf ears.

Once, I shared a painful experience in my life with someone that I genuinely thought was my friend and they very plainly responded with:

“We aren’t that kind of friends.”

I can look back on that and respect her boundaries.

But at the time, it was heart-wrenching.

Sadly, it didn’t stop me. In fact, I doubled down on vulnerability and found myself in multiple situations where my vulnerability was used as a weapon against me.

With the help of Gene Keys and Brene Brown’s words, I started to wise up, though.

I started to pay more attention to who had “earned the right” to my vulnerability. Probably more importantly, I started to pay close attention to who was critical of my vulnerable nature.

Are they daring greatly, as Theodore Roosevelt said?

Are they in the arena?

Are they doing something with their lives that I admire?

Or are they just being an armchair critic?

Are they using my vulnerability for their own gain or were they willing to traverse it with me to create more connection and intimacy?

The answers to those questions really matter and help guide me as I encounter “feedback” about my level of vulnerability.

I’d love to say that it never hurts when my vulnerability isn’t received well. Because it still does sometimes. I am a human being with normal human feelings, afterall.

But, I am more discerning. And in the times I get it wrong, I’m learning to let go of attachment to how my sharing is received. True to the 5th line, I am trusting that what other people think about me is on them, and that when I share with the people who do truly love me, it sets the stage for others to do the same.

And that risk is worth it to me. Because I do want to live in a world where we can deeply understand one another and that can only happen through vulnerability, honesty, and willingness to risk other people’s opinions.

Using your Human Design to create affirmations is a powerful way to activate the full potential of your chart. Here are some affirmations for Gate 59:

### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 60 (Gene Key 60)

Gate 60 isundefinedin my chart, but it holds a very special place in my heart. I know I say that a lot, for different reasons, but this one is deeply connected to truly understanding my gifts and the value I bring to the world.

My very firstmapcustomer has gate 60 in their conscious sun.

Back then, I didn’t know thehuman design gatesthe way that I do now. I hadn’t quite realized that the gates “speak to me” and that I had a natural affinity with them. And it was gate 60 that cracked open that door.

I can remember very clearly sitting down to study gate 60.

I was surrounded by piles ofHuman Design, Gene Keys, and IChing books. I was taking notes as fast as my hand would go.

By the end, I had tears streaming down my face because I knew how important it was to get this information out to people.

And, in a moment ofself recognition, I knew I had a unique, more empowering way of translating the system. I saw, clear as day, why people had been begging me to explain their design to them.

I understood my gifts in a whole new way. I was more than “just a writer” or walking, talking firehose of esoteric information. In those moments, I knew that my words would change the way people experience their Human Design.

Traditional Human Design is often taught in a disempowering way.

There are literally “analysts” and “readers” who tell people, based on specific gates in their chart, that they are evil, doomed to fail, or other such disempowering bullshit.

I once had an HD reader tell me that I should close my business, file for unemployment, and play video games for the rest of my life.

And that is just the beginning of what I’ve seen.

There are indeed some gates in the chart that, because of conditioning and Ra’s intention to reach people through their “not-self,” can seem intense at first glance.

But a different story unfolds when we look deeper at thefull spectrum of potential.

Gate 60 is one of the prime examples.

In traditional Human Design, gate 60 is known as the gate of limitation. It is the energy of boundaries, structure, and restriction.

Some pretty gnarly shit has gone down when gate 60 wastransitingplanets like Saturn, Uranus, Pluto, etc. And, my firstmapclient definitely didn’t have a life of skipping through fields of flowers, rainbows, and butterflies either.

All of that is true.

AND

There is a whole other side of the story.

While writing that very firstmap, with gate 60 as the conscious sun, the other side was blazingly obvious.

I didn’t see limitations, rigid structure, or smackdowns from life.

I saw potential, creativity, and ingenuity.

I saw magick.

Because here is the thing:

Creativity and magick are BORN from limits.

Your house is safe because of its walls. Rivers need banks to flow. iPhones, cars, and GPS were all created to solve a “limitation.”

Some of the most beautiful art in the world was made with leftover paint and brushes that should have long been in the trash.

As they say, necessity is the mother of invention.

Without limits, boundaries, and problems, there is no need for creativity and magick. They are fuel for our evolution and growth as a species.

Humans find a way. We make something out of nothing. We create from the (root) pressure of limits. We make magick with it.

How could it be any other way? It’s how the game is played.

And I am 100% on board with that. It is actually what I teach inside theHuman Design Mapportal. Your chart isn’t a fate written in stone; it is a tool for your creativity and deepest alchemical transformation.

The difference is in attitude and using our so-called limitations as an opportunity. It is looking for the potential inside of limitation.

It is embracing our real limitations and letting the perceived one’s go. Just like a river and its banks. Gate 60 is what makes us truly limitless.

Embrace the magick of your chart by getting yourmapand going on the journey inside the portal.

## Affirmations for Human Design Gate 60

Using your Human Design to create affirmations is a powerful way to activate the full potential of your chart. Here are some affirmations for Gate 60:

### My Personal Experience with Human Design Gate 61 (Gene Key 61)

Gate 61 has a lot of significance in my life because it is defined in the Unconscious Earth of myincarnation cross.

In the Human Design chart, I interpret the Unconscious Earth placement as your unique path to that thing that some call God.

It is a tool for feeling connected to yourself, the people in your life, the collective, and the cosmos. And it provides the spiritual foundation necessary to unlock the expanded consciousness in the other gates of yourincarnation cross.(I’ll explain all four gates of yourincarnation crossin theHuman Design Map.)

So, my path to “God” is reveling in the mystery of life; in being a contemplative mystic, looking for the golden thread in all things. In doing so, I unlock the full potential of my gifts and purpose.

And, OMG (no pun intended), what a ride it has been.

I actually have the full channel (61-24) defined in my chart.

As far back as I can remember, I have felt deeply connected with the mystery of life and the Divinity of everything.

But, I was raised in a religious context that believed there was one, and only one, path to “God.”

I’d sit in church completely confused.

I could feel the Golden Threads of Truth running through the sermons. I’d often get chills or cry.

But the hellfire, damnation, and insistence of unworthiness never resonated with me. Never mind the gossip, bold-faced hypocrisy, and isms as deep as the ocean (racism, sexism, classism, etc.).

My relationship with the “God” of my childhood unraveled very early.

I remember being 18 years old, pissed off at my parents, and yelling that I didn’t believe in God.

In hindsight (and true togate 24), I can clearly see that it had nothing to do with believing in “God.”

I just didn’t believe in the God they believed in. And I didn’t know that what I believe (about anything, including God) is a choice. I was completely unaware of the free will to select the way we think.

All of that changed when, through the mystery of Grace, I stumbled onto the work ofRichard Rohr.

The first book I read of his was calledFalling Upward. And, as they say in the East, a meeting with the Divine and the river changes course.

My interpretation of what he says is this:

When terrible things happen, we try to reconcile those things with the God that we believe in. And if we can’t do that reconciliation, we have two choices.

We can make God “small” by collapsing our definition of it. Or, we can make God “bigger” by expanding our definition of it.

“In order to see God, you have to have special eyes. Otherwise, you cannot bear the shock.” ~Neem Karoli Baba

The idea that I could make God bigger shocked me; it was the first of many spiritual awakenings.

I saw that when I told my parents that God isn’t real, it was because I had collapsed my definition of God. I hadn’t known I could make my definition of God big enough to hold the trauma I was carrying.

But, in Richard Rohr’s book, I saw I had a choice.

True to the 61-24, from that moment on, I began to revisit my definition of God repeatedly. It became my spiritual practice to make God big enough to holdallmy experiences, even the horrible ones.

Since then, I have studied spiritual traditions and beliefs from all over the world. I’ve looked for the Golden Thread that runs through them all, and I opened myself up to more powerful ways of thinking about God.

I’ve resonated most with Hermeticism (aka magick) and traditions from the East. What has been most interesting, though, is that I also really enjoy learning about the different ways people interpret the Bible and seeing those old sermons in a whole new way.

All of these things shape the way I live, the way I write, and the way I teach Human Design through themap + portal.

Most importantly, though, I’ve stopped believing that there is only one path to that thing that some call God. Instead, there are64 archetypesplaying out in a gazillion and one ways.

I’ve realized that Truth is subjective and that our inner wisdom is what guides our truth.

We tend to think of Truth as being objective. But, most of the things we believe are “the truth” are really just thoughts, beliefs, and ideas. They are inherited from our conditioning, rather than chosen on purpose.

The realgood newsis that thoughts and beliefs are always optional.

We don’t “have to” believe anything.

We are all just making it up as we go along.

No one knows for sure.

A younger version of me would have been terrified at that idea; it gives me so much freedom now.

“What I know

Is that I don’t know.

So I dance, and I sing, and I live full.

I give it all to the call of the unknown.”

Trevor Hall, The Fruitful Darkness, What I Know

I can now play, experiment, and see what resonates. If something doesn’t resonate, I can let it go. And if it does, I can hold it lightly enough to let it go if it starts to feel like I’m collapsing or if it bounds me up in attachments.

This surrender to “not knowing” is the spiritual underpinning that informs my approach to Human Design. And it is why me and my team are devoted to pointing people back to their inner knowing inside theHuman Design Map + Portal.

I’m not attached to the idea that there is only one way to use Human Design, that what Ra said was the ultimate Truth, or that you can get it wrong. That feels ways too small for me.

Instead, I choose to believe that my soul is always on the “right” path – even if it looks nothing like my chart. I choose to believe that God is everything – there is nothing that is not Divine. I trust what resonates in my body and lands with holiness. The mystery always plays out perfectly.

And so it is.

## Affirmations for Human Design Gate 61

Using your Human Design to create affirmations is a powerful way to activate the full potential of your chart. Here are some affirmations for Gate 61:

### The Positive and Negative Sides of Human Design Gate 62

All energy in theHuman Design chart exists on a spectrum of potential.

On the “positive” end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 62 is the energy for taking complicated concepts (especially esoteric ones) and organizing them into workable language, plans, and instructions. For Gate 62, transformation begins by understanding the details – especially what is objective versus subjective – and transforming those details into precise and clear language. This in turn helps others to create transformation in their lives.

On the “negative” end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 62 is the energy for using its logic and knowledge to hide insecurities; it obsesses with facts, details, organizing, and planning. It can also get trapped in information seeking or become overwhelmed when ideas don’t seem “workable.”

You’ll learn about the surprising (but most effective) way to raise your energy frequency in theHuman Design Map + Portal.

The most important thing to raise the frequency of gate 62 is to get (inner) clarity about the relevant amount of facts, details, and planning necessary to create solutions. And to remember that you are not your thoughts.

### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 62 (Gene Key 62)

Gate 62 is defined in the unconscious sun of myincarnation cross.

Aas someone obsessed withshadowintegration and parts work, the unconscious sun is one of the most interesting gates of the whole chart.

The unconscious side of the chart reveals the wounds, the golden shadow parts, and the stories that keep us stuck and prevent the full potential of our purpose and contribution on the conscious side of the chart.

The unconscious sun in particular represents the part of ourselves that is actually our most attractive quality to the world (in a platonic way).

But, it doesn’t always feel that way on the inside because it is also where we “store” our self-doubt and “not-enoughness.” And, it is a doorway that opens our Golden Shadows. Once we recognize the magick that is our unconscious sun, we begin a journey of healing all of the shadows on the unconscious side.

(With yourHuman Design Map & Portal, you will discover the golden and taboo shadows of your type, authority, profile, and all four gates of your incarnation cross. And, the best part of all, you will learn how to heal the shadows that keep you stuck in people pleasing, indecision, and not trusting yourself.Get yours here.)

For me, with Gate 62 in my unconscious sun, it means that my way with words is highly magnetic to the people around me.

My whole life, people have commented on my ways with words, especially the way I can organize and explain esoteric concepts. They love how I break things down and make even convoluted concepts (like Human Design!) seem clear.

I’m celebrated for step-by-step guidance, clear and piercing language, and busting myths. Yourmap and portalare loaded with it.

But what most people don’t see or understand is that, while these things do come quite naturally to me, they have also been my deepest sources of inner turmoil. 😲

For most of my life, I would beat myself up about not knowing how to explain things. Or not being specific enough. Or not giving enough details.

Not enough. Not enough. Not enough.

In many ways, these insecurities have also been a source of deep bitterness because the story of “not enough” almost always leads to people-pleasing, an imbalance in giving and receiving, and wasting a lot of energy “making sure” I  have all the facts before speaking.

But, when I understood the nature of the unconscious sun, it unlocked something for me that really changed this dynamic.

I started to notice those insecurities instead of acting them out.

I felt the feelings. I did the shadow integration work. I reclaimed the fractured parts of my power. And I started making conscious choices about how I’d show up for my writing and step-by-step guidance.

(That is exactly what you will learn how to do in theHuman Design Map & Portal.)

I stopped letting those not-enough stories prevent me from showing up with integrity. I’ve become willing to refine as I gather details, facts, or information. I don’t seek perfection. And I trust the evolution of my consciousness.

I’ve also come to understand that staying on the leading edge of awareness is a huge part of why I can explain things so easily. I am deeply attuned to the words, phrases, and ways of explaining things that create confusion. I am not married to the words that cause more harm than good and am not afraid to go back to the drawing board when necessary.

And, true to the unconscious sun placement, the more I’ve done that inner healing work, the more recognition I receive about the esoteric translator that radiates from my being.

A day doesn’t go by where I don’t hear a compliment about my way with words or the way I break things down. I am honored to say that, insidethe map portal, I receive abundant praise and recognition for what I do.

And the practice of receiving that recognition encourages me to trust that my way with words is enough. And that it is safe to let go, on deeper and deeper levels, the idea that I’m saying the wrong thing or not explaining things well.

It is all unfolding perfectly. And what a beautiful expanding spiral of transformation it is.

### The Positive and Negative Sides of Human Design Gate 63

All energy in theHuman Design chart exists on a spectrum of potential.

On the “positive” end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 63 is the energy for making sense of patterns by working through doubt. Gate 63 sees distorted energy as an opportunity for truth, therefore, it asks itself and others powerful questions. And the answer to those questions shatter doubt, impossibility, and hesitation and reveal the true potential that exists in all things.

On the “negative” end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 63 is the energy of struggling with self-doubt or planting unnecessary doubt into others’ minds. It never takes action due to doubt and blames external things for the doubt and their results.

You’ll learn about the surprising (but most effective) way to raise your energy frequency in theHuman Design Map + Portal.

In the meantime, start noticing when you are feeling fearful, obsessive or like a victim, but don’t be an asshole to yourself. Treat yourself the way you would a small child – with love, curiosity, and understanding.

### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 63 (Gene Key 63)

Gate 63 is undefined in my chart, but I have a defined Head/Ajna. So, I am intimately familiar with how the head pressures the Ajna with questions.

When we don’t keep those questions in check, it can send us in all sorts of unhelpful directions.

The main question that gate 63 asks is what.

And my “flavor” of gate 63 questions has been:

What is wrong with me?

What am I missing?

What am I doing wrong?

Doubt. Doubt. Doubt.

For a long time, I thought that experiencing doubt meant that I was too broken or messed up to do much of anything with my life.

When I noticed doubt, I made it mean imminent failure and that I would never succeed.

Things started to shift in 2014 when I went to a coaching mastermind in Napa Valley.

The weather was gorgeous. I was delighted to be connecting with so many like-minded people. The deep conversations were spectacular, and I met people I am still friends with.

I was absolutely high on life. Truth be told, I was probably high on the amplification of such “positive” sacral and solar plexus energy, but whatever.

Anyway, during one of the mastermind sessions, there was a group Q + A with my mentor. She always appeared confident in her ability to create the life she wanted, and I was convinced that she never experienced doubt.

I hesitantly asked…

Do you ever feel doubt?

In her confident voice, she replied:

Of course, I just don’t let it drive my actions.

It took me some time to really sink into the meaning of her words.

I can’t say for sure what they really meant for her.

But what I have come to understand, and teach others inside theHuman Design Map, is that we are “meant” to experience it all.

It wouldn’t be in the chart if it weren’t a normal part of the human experience.

Doubt is not actually a problem. Nothing is going wrong when doubt shows up – for any reason. It only becomes a problem when we assign meaning to it and use it as fuel for actions that keep us stuck in the low frequency of our purpose.

But, even more important is that we can transform the frequency of the doubt and turn it into fuel for actions aligned with our higher purpose.

We do that by seeing doubt as a signal to explore all of the possibilities.

You turn the doubt on its head (pun intended 😉) and let it open you up instead of shutting you down.

This, as with all things, is a process. You won’t get it right on the first try. And you’ll have to remind yourself repeatedly that doubt is evidence that you are a normal human being and nothing else.

Since gate 63 is undefined in my chart, I’ll be learning more ways of working with doubt as I continue through life.

But, for now, I am really grateful for what I’ve learned so far, and I welcome more opportunities to expand my mind to what is really possible when we get out of our own way.If you want a guide on your path, invite me by getting yourHuman Design Map and reaching out to me inside the portal.

### The Positive and Negative Sides of Human Design Gate 64

All energy in theHuman Design chart exists on a spectrum of potential.

On the “positive” of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 64 is the energy for lovingly embracing the confusion inherent in illumination. Gate 64 lives in a land of infinite possibilities and potential and is only limited by its imagination. With this understanding of reality, Gate 64 is able to keep its eye on the highest potential and possibility – even when confusion clouds everything beyond the next step.

On the “negative” end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 64 is the energy for putting pressure on itself to figure things out the moment it feels confused.  With this approach, Gate 64 starts to shut down potential and possibilities. It can find itself worried about the “how” instead of focusing on the next step.

You’ll learn about the surprising (but most effective) way to raise your energy frequency in theHuman Design Map + Portal.

In the meantime, start noticing when you are feeling anxious, confused or pessimistic, but don’t be an asshole to yourself. Treat yourself the way you would a small child – with love, curiosity, and understanding.

### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 64 (Gene Key 64)

Back when I was doing one-to-one coaching, I had a client with the full 64/47 channel of abstraction. She is a business coach for artists and we met because we did life coach training from the same place.

In that circle, confusion had a really bad wrap. And it was something we talked about many, many times.

With the 64/47, confusion was an old friend and she had gotten into the habit of shaming herself for feeling confused.

But, what I helped her see is that, as with all energy, gate 64 (aka the energy of confusion) is ona spectrumand all ends of the spectrum are available to us.

None of it is right or wrong. It just is. And the key to your energetic success is knowing how to work with your energy. That is what you’ll learn how to do when you get yourHuman Design Map.

Here is an example of what that might look like in “real” life with the 64:

Imagine for a moment that you have been training to climb a mountain for 6 months straight. You go all in on your training and you have a deep inner knowing that you will make it to the top. You are clear and ready.

But, on the day you plan to start the actual climb, it is an incredibly foggy day. You cannot see the top of the mountain.

On the “negative” end of the 64 spectrum, you would turn around and go home because you can’t see, with your actual eyes, how you will get to the top. You “indulge” in not knowing the how.

But, on the “positive” side of the 64 spectrum, you would proceed, knowing that you don’t need to see the whole path. You just need to trust that you will make it to the top of the mountain by putting one foot in front of the other. You stay in the possibility instead of in the fog.

See the difference?

When we let the metaphorical fog stop us from doing what we know to do and put one foot in front of the other, we never really get anywhere. But when we remember that fog is just a reminder that there is infinite potential on this crazy green spinning rock and that all we have to ever do is take the next step.

“Confusion clouds the heart but it also points the way.”Trevor Hall, You can’t Rush Your Healing, Kala

When my client began practicing that, it changed everything for her. No more shaming herself for feeling confused and instead, alchemizing that into potent fuel for the very next step.

Clarity, via the a-ha moment of the47, is coming.

And, quite honestly, it has changed everything for me, too.

Gate 64 is undefined in my chart (though I do have a defined head) and, over the course of my life, I have learned that you really do only need to be able to see the next step.

And when you can surrender the how and just trust your knowing of the potential and possibilities, all tends to work itself out.

The right people will show up to help. The tools will become clear. The whole path will reveal itself at the end.

So, don’t let confusion stop you. And don’t let it become a weapon you use against yourself. Trust yourself. You do know what to do. Just put one foot in front of the other. And do that over and over again.

And, if you feel “blocked” along the way, that is an indicator that there is some deconditioning to do. I’ll show you the next steps inside theHuman Design Mapportal.
