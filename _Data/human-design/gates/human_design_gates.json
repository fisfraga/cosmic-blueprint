TheHuman Design Mapis for you.)\n\n### The Positive and Negative Sides of Human Design Gate 1\n\nAll energy in theHuman Design chart exists on a spectrum of potential.\n\nOn one end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 1 is the energy for Creativity. It leads by example and knows that it\u2019s greatest impact on the world happens when you stay true to your creative process.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 1 is the energy for believing that you should be able to be creative all the time or that being depressed or low means that something is wrong with you. It Resists your creative ebbs and flows.\n\nYou\u2019ll learn about the surprising (but most effective) way to raise your energy frequency in theHuman Design Map + Portal.\n\nIn the meantime, start noticing when you are feeling anxious, needy or moody but don\u2019t be an asshole to yourself. Treat yourself the way you would a small child \u2013 with love, curiosity, and understanding.\n\n### My Personal Experience with Human Design Gate 1 (Gene Key 1)\n\nGate 1 is the G Center side of the 1-8 Channel of Inspiration.\n\n(I do a deep dive on all channels inside the Human Design Map portal.Get yours here.)\n\nAnd while gate 1 is undefined in my chart, I do haveHuman Design Gate 8defined in my unconscious Jupiter. And, since both the 1 and the 8 areprojected gates,\u00a0 some have said that gate 8 is like the PR team for gate 1.\n\nThe other interesting thing to note is that according to theGene Keys, the unconscious Jupiter is the \u201cculture\u201d sphere inthe pearl sequence. The pearl sequence is how prosperity is activated in our charts. And the \u201cculture\u201d sphere is like the thing that the people in your orbit value the most.\n\nWhich means that in my business, the thing that my people value the most is making a contribution by being their authentic selves (gate 8).\n\n((You\u2019ll learn even more about what your Human Design tells you about marketing and business inside theHuman Design Mapportal.)\n\nSo, with the full picture of Gate 8 being like the PR team and Gate 1 being the creativity, I tend to draw in highly creative people who really want to make a contribution in the world. They want to make marks that make a difference.\n\nAnd one of the things I\u2019ve noticed is that people with Gate 1 defined in their chart have a tendency to hold the story that if they aren\u2019t at the top Creative game, that something is wrong with them.\n\nThey often expect to be on a creative high 24\/7 and start to question themselves and their purpose (human design gate 28) when they are feeling low. Those low feelings roll in, and, all of a sudden, t\n\nhey start telling themselves that the Universe is punishing them for being human. They tell themselves that if they were better at managing their emotions or could just stay \u201chigh vibe,\u201d they would be Creative all the time.\n\nI\u2019ve been there myself more times than I could even count.\n\nWhat I\u2019ve come to understand, in both helping people who have gate 1 defined and in my own experience of creativity, is that it is so important to trust the natural ebbs and flows of creaticity. And that it doesn\u2019t actually mean anything has gone wrong when you aren\u2019t banging away at a creative project.\n\nAnd the story that you are somehow unworthy because of the \u201cnegitive vibes\u201d actually hinders the process of creativity. The low feelings are a critical part of the creative process.\n\nAs we stay present with the lows and allow ourselves to alchemize them in a natural way, rather than trying to push them away, they become creative fuel. They become a part of the story of our art and craft.\n\n(I\u2019ll show you the ropes of how true alchemy works inside theHuman Design Mapportal. If you are already one of mymapclients, go to your portal dashboard and start at the beginning of the Deconditioning Toolbox.)\n\nThe only thing the \u201clow vibes\u201d prove is your humanity. You cannot make beautiful art (literal or metaphorical) without them. It is the full spectrum of what it means to be human that is most beautiful.\n\nUp and down it goes like a great wave across my own homeAll the questions of the mind trying to find a way to showThat I got darkness I got light I got everything in betweenDon\u2019t deny any sideI don\u2019t cut branches off my treeGreat storm clouds holding rainIt\u2019s part of nature to hold a bit of painAll in all, that rain falls, and then we watch a new thing growTrevor Hall, In and Through the Body, \u200bGreat Storm Clouds\n\nHuman Design Gate 1 shows us that \u201cthe low\u201d is just as important as \u201cthe high\u201d in your most authentic self-expression. Its energy. In motion.\n\nI\u2019ll show you how to embody that inside theHuman Design Mapportal.\n\nIn the meantime, be present with yourself. Let the \u201clow vibes\u201d be a part of your process and you will make even more profound art.\n\nIt can only be that way.\n\n## Affirmations for Human Design Gate 1\n\nUsing your Human Design to create affirmations is a powerful way to activate the full potential of your chart. Here are some affirmations for Gate 1:\n\nI honor my natural creative cycles.\n\nI am a creative powerhouse.\n\nI surrender to the highs and lows of creativity.\n\nInside yourHuman Design Map, you\u2019ll get a full list of empowering beliefs for your type + strategy, authority, profile, and all four gates of yourincarnation crossand show you how to go from affirmation to full-on embodiment. In the meantime, be sure to also check out my post onhow to make Human Design affirmations work.\n\n### Now it\u2019s your turn to contemplate Gate 1\n\nWhen you stand in the Truth that your lows don\u2019t mean anything about your Creative potential\u2026\n\nWhat does Creativity mean to you?\n\nAre you connected to your Creativity?\n\nDo you make your low feelings mean something about your Creativity and your worthiness? Why do you think that is?\n\nHow can you honor your Creative highs more often? And what do you need to take care of yourself when you are in a Creative low?\n\nWho are your biggest allies who can remind you of your Creative genius?\n\nI encourage you to take some time with these questions. Take them out into your world and let their answers reveal themselves to you.

Gate 2 knows that life is a balance of feminine and masculine and that receiving the gifts of life is true abundance.\n\nOn the \u201cnegative\u201d end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 2 is the energy for spending resources (time, money, energy) recklessly. It doubts, worries, and feels anxious about its needs being met and has no faith in their ability to receive abundance.\n\nYou\u2019ll learn about the surprising (but most effective) way to raise your energy frequency in theHuman Design Map + Portal.\n\nIn the meantime, start noticing when you are spending recklessly, but don\u2019t be an asshole to yourself. Treat yourself the way you would a small child \u2013 with love, curiosity, and understanding.\n\n### My Personal Experience with Human Design Gate 2 (Gene Key 2)\n\nWhen I was in the second grade, I wrote a story that was published in the local newspaper. And my teacher was way more excited about it than I was. She kept telling me how proud she was that I\u2019d had something published at such a young age.\n\nNow, of course, we weren\u2019t talking about the New York Times, here. But to the adults around me, it seemed like a big deal and I was completely confused.\n\nTruth be told, I was very uncomfortable with the praise.\n\nThe thing is, writing has always come naturally to me. I\u2019d even go so far as to say that it\u2019s easy.\n\nMyhead,ajna,throat,spleen, andGare all defined. My throat alone has six defined gates (62, 16, 20, 31, 8, and 56), three of which are full channels (16-48, 57-20, and 31-7).\n\nGate 62is in theunconscious sunof myincarnation cross\u2014known for communicating complex ideas with clarity and precision.\n\nAnd I have a Gemini Moon conjunct Jupiter in the second house.\n\nSo you might say it was written in the stars for me to be a wordsmith.\n\nBut at the time, my ability to write felt\u2026 ordinary.\n\nMy brain and nervous system didn\u2019t have the capacity to believe that something so easy for me could be worthy of praise. I didn\u2019t have the ability to let it in.\n\nLearning that Gate 2 is undefined in my chart helped that experience click into place.\n\nIn Human Design,the undefined places in our chartare where we\u2019re here to grow, to observe with compassion, and eventually to gain deep wisdom. But that wisdom doesn\u2019t arrive overnight. It unfolds through lived experience\u2014and that is exactly what is happening with my capacity to receive.\n\nLooking back, I can see that moment for what it was: a key moment in learning to receive.\n\nIn time, I\u2019ve come to recognize that writing is one of my gifts. I have a unique way of thinking, ordering, and playing with words that others appreciate. And it\u2019s teaching me how to receive on so many levels.\n\nWriting isn\u2019t just a thing I do or the way I deliver value with the\u200bHuman Design Map & Portal\u200b. It is a spiritual practice. Where I understand myself, the world around me, and that thing that some call God.\n\nThere is a mercurial kind of magick that happens when I put my fingers on the keyboard (or pen to paper!) that often leaves me in awe.\n\nAnd that is exactly what happened in the early days of creating my signature energy healing method (now taught inside the\u200bHuman Design Map & Portal\u200bas the MAP Method for Deconditioning).\n\nBack then, it was called something different. But the essence hasn\u2019t changed at all.\n\nIts structure and flow are based on alchemical magick. It walks you through the seven healing phases that underpin all transformation. It works no matter what you\u2019re trying to change because it gets to the heart of why we ignore our inner wisdom and reveals how to leverage our natural energy in fully aligned ways.\n\nEach phase of the process has an energetic objective that lets you know exactly where you are in the healing arc\u2014and signals when you\u2019re ready to move into the next phase.(I walk you through this entire process step-by-step inside the MAP Method, which is included in the\u200bHuman Design Map & Portal\u200b.)\n\nThe last phase of the alchemical process is what I call \u201cThe Promised Land.\u201d And when writing it, I had a realization so simple and clarifying that I could hardly believe what my fingers were typing:\n\nReceiving is feeling. It is allowing your body to fully experience the sensations of fulfillment.\n\nMaybe you call those sensations success, satisfaction, peace, delightful surprise\u2026 or even abundance, affirmation, or alignment.\n\nWhatever you call it, though, they are alive in your body and the process is the same:\n\nYou locate the sensation in your body. You stay with the feeling. You let it vibrate through you.\n\nNo analyzing. No pretending to be humble. No pushing it away with confusion. No minimizing what you\u2019ve created. No writing it off as a fluke.\n\nBut instead\u2014opening to it. Softening into it. Letting it enter your being.\n\nLetting yourselfbecomethe vibration in real-time.\n\nLetting yourself know, in your bones, what it feels like for your heart to expand.\n\nWhat it feels like for your aura to hum at that frequency.\n\nWhat it feels like when joy, reverence, gratitude, abundance, bliss, and pleasurewash through your entire being.\n\nTo receive is to surrender to the full spectrum of \u201cpositive\u201d emotions that are available to you as a human being.\n\nWhat a revelation.\n\nSince that moment, I\u2019ve coached hundreds\u2014if not thousands\u2014of people through the practice of receiving. Watching the light bulb go off is always miraculous.\n\nAnd on a personal level, it has healed so much.\n\nWhen I bring something to fruition in my life, I now understand that my work\u2014completing the cycle of alchemy\u2014is to be present in my body. To let the feelings of success move through me.\n\nEvery time I remember and practice that, my capacity for more success expands. It clears out the \u201cblocks\u201d that prevent me from receiving more love, abundance, and magick.\n\nAnd writing?\n\nIt\u2019s still one of the most natural things in the world for me.\n\nBut now, when someone tells me that my words moved them\u2026\n\nWhen a client says my work changed their life\u2026\n\nWhen I\u2019m acknowledged for the clarity, precision, or depth I bring\u2026\n\nI can feel it. I canlet it in.\n\nI notice when I want to deflect, downplay, or disappear in the moment. And make the conscious choice to breathe it in. To let it move me. To receive it.\n\nIt\u2019s as simple and as profound as that.\n\nAnd what once felt confusing now feels like truth.\n\nThe energy of Gate 2 has shown me that receiving isn\u2019t passive\u2014it\u2019s presence. If you\u2019re ready to open to your own capacity for alignment, abundance, and purpose, the\u200bHuman Design Map & Portal\u200bwill show you the way.\n\n\u200b\ud83d\udc49 Click here to get your Human Design Map & Portal\u200b.\n\n## Affirmations for Human Design Gate 2\n\nUsing your Human Design to create affirmations is a powerful way to activate the full potential of your chart.

Why or why not?\n\nWhat does gratitude feel like in your body? What about Joy? Appreciation? Reverence? Respect? Affirmation? Abundance? Prosperity? Bliss? Ecstasy?\n\nAre you willing to feel even more of those things? Why or why not?\n\nI encourage you to take some time with these questions.

Gate 3 knows that the beginning of change is the hardest part and loves to create innovative ways to overcome obstacles and face them with a light-hearted touch.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 3 is the energy for feeling disempowered, disordered, or out of control, and can experience a lot of frustration with God about living in a chaotic world.\n\nYou\u2019ll learn about the surprising (but most effective) way to raise your energy frequency in theHuman Design Map + Portal.\n\nIn the meantime, start noticing when you are feeling bored, unimaginative or don\u2019t feel like finishing something but don\u2019t be an asshole to yourself. Treat yourself the way you would a small child \u2013 with love, curiosity, and understanding.\n\n## My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 3 (Gene Key 3)\n\nGate 3.4 is defined in my conscious and unconscious Chiron (often called the wounded healer) and directly conjunct my Rising. Meaning my identity (rising) is inseparable from (conjunct) helping others heal what I cannot heal in myself (chiron).\n\nNeither our Rising nor Chiron create definition in the bodygraph. However, when it comes to Chiron, Ra Uru Hu was adamant about its significance as we age. In fact, for 6th lineprofiles, the Chiron Return marks coming \u201coff the roof\u201d and stepping into the role model identity.\n\n(Want a deep dive on your profile? You\u2019ll love the detail and support in theHuman Design Map & Portal.)\n\nBecoming wise over the course of one\u2019s life isn\u2019t limited to sixth lines, though; it is the heart of the human story. And Chiron was an example of that.\n\nIn Greek mythology, Chiron was a wise and immortal centaur\u2014teacher, guide, and healer to the gods. Hercules accidentally shot Chiron with a deadly poisoned arrow. But because Chiron was immortal, the arrow created an un-healable wound and he was forced to suffer for eternity.\n\nMeanwhile, something else was happening in the mythic realm.\n\nAnother god\u2014Prometheus\u2014had defied Zeus by stealing fire from the heavens and giving it to humanity. That fire wasn\u2019t just warmth or light; it was the divine spark of consciousness, creativity, and transformation.\n\nFor this rebellion, Zeus chained Prometheus to a rock, where an eagle came each day to eat his liver. Every night, the liver regenerated, and the suffering continued\u2014an eternal punishment for giving humans the power of fire.\n\nSeeing the deep need for humans to be bestowed with creative fire, Chiron gave up his immortality to free Prometheus.\n\nWe could rabbit-hole on the golden threads of symbolism there all day. But what really moves me is how it lives inside my own chart\u2014and how it\u2019s shaped my actual life.\n\nIn the IChing, Gate 3 is called \u201cDifficulty at the Beginning.\u201d It comes with the kind of chaos that can make you question every choice you ever made\u2014your plan, your path, your purpose, and yourself.\n\nAnd while facing chaos in my own beginnings has always been a struggle, helping others transmute chaos into power and magic? That\u2019s always come easily.\n\nWhen I first started my business in 2009\u2014long before I found Human Design\u2014I was working as a health coach. I helped women with food and body image healing and I immediately noticed a powerful pattern:\n\nPeople would decide to change, and like clockwork, everything would fall apart. Not just slip-ups or doubts\u2014real chaos. Things got worse instead of better. They blamed themselves. Called themselves weak. Spun in shame.\n\nToday, I see the same thing inside theHuman Design Map Portal.\n\nAs humans, we tend to believe that chaos means that we are doing something wrong.\n\nBut, when I am helping someone navigate the brave work of making new, purposeful, and aligned choices, it is always crystal clear to me that nothing is going wrong.\n\nTheir intentions are working. They are walking the path. They are more powerful than they ever realized.\n\nChaos is the sign of that deep truth. It is an invitation to look with fresh eyes.\n\nBecause the thing is this\u2014the first stage of alchemy is FIRE.\n\nYou throw the symbolic lead into the symbolic flames, and it burns away anything that isn\u2019t aligned with your gold.\n\nSo when the shit hits the fan at the beginning? That\u2019s not failure. That\u2019s alchemy coming in hot. Literally.\n\nThe problem is that if we\u2019re spinning in shame, we miss the message. We think the chaos means we\u2019re broken or off track, when it\u2019s actually evidence that magick is afoot.\n\nThis has been a core part of my message for well over a decade now. Chaos is expected and necessary.\n\nAnd when that clicks for someone, like really in their bones clicks, it is like watching a light bulb turn on.\n\nShame transforms into curiosity. Resistance softens into presence. Shadows become light.\n\nAs if it were Divinely written, it\u2019s exactly what I teach inside theHuman Design Map & Portal. And with each person I guide, it\u2019s a moment of remembering for me, too. When their shame transforms, so does mine. It brings me back to my own humanity and the knowing that I am not alone.\n\nKnowing that my Rising and Chiron sit together in 3.4 helps, too. I can see the threads and the invitation\u2014to allow my creative fire to lead, and to sacrifice my shame in order to do it.\n\nTruth be told, I still sometimes catch myself being hard on myself when things don\u2019t flow right out of the gate. I have to remind myself that chaos is not a failure\u2014chaos is themap. And, paradoxically, it\u2019s a natural part of order.\n\nNone of us get to skip the reality of being human. The 3-60 format channel teaches us that the mystery of chaos (3) and magick (60) is just part of what it means to be alive.\n\nAnd what I know for sure is this:\n\nMaking art\u2026transformation\u2026giving birth to a new identity\u2026 is messy.\n\nDifficulty at the beginning is not a problem. It\u2019s part of the story\u2014and embracing it is how magick is made.\n\nWhen we approach that chaos with our eyes and hearts wide open, surrendering our shame to the fire, it all turns to gold in the end.\n\nIt can only be that way.\n\nIf you\u2019re standing in the middle of your own new beginning and everything feels chaotic, please know that you\u2019re not doing it wrong.\n\nYou\u2019re in the fire. And it is indeed making gold.\n\nTheHuman Design Map & Portalis where I\u2019ll help you embrace the fire and find your way through it. You\u2019ll learn the mechanics of your unique design\u2014but even more than that, you\u2019ll learn how to work with your patterns gently, wisely, and without shame.\n\n\u200b\ud83d\udc49 Click here to get your Map & Portal.\n\n## Affirmations for Human Design Gate 3\n\nUsing your Human Design to create affirmations is a powerful way to activate the full potential of your chart.

I\u2019d written it in the order of the suntransitsand only had a small number of gates left to go.\n\nThere were many layers of work that went into getting the library published. My part was to write these personal contemplations and my due date was a couple months before the transit itself. This allowed plenty of time and space for my team to do their part.\n\nAnd one thing I found quite magical was how the timing of writing the contemplation seemed to be perfectly aligned with something happening in my life at that time. It didn\u2019t matter that the transit itself was 2 months away.\n\nWhich, side note, because the Human Design gates are symbols of human archetypes, they arealwaysrelevant. You could pick any gate at random and find the benefit of contemplating it right then and there. The transits simply shine specific light onto them and give us the opportunity to see them through that specific lens.\n\nAnyway, back to the 4.\n\nFor whatever reason, when the due date for the 4 originally came up, I put it off for over a week. I had no energy for it.\n\nI\u2019d been in a deep hole of unprocessed anger and the idea of writing about forgiveness felt like a cosmic joke.\n\nAs you may already know, I\u2019m a 5\/2 profile and my aura is surrounded by the \u201cdouble projection field.\u201d Which essentially means that my karmic role is to clean up karma by being on the receiving end of two different types of projection.\n\n(You\u2019ll learn more about your profile and karmic role in theHuman Design Map.)\n\nLearning about my 5\/2 profile was the thing that got me hooked on Human Design. Coming to understand the double projection field shifted my entire perspective. In an instant, I saw myself, my life, and my relationships with crystalline clarity.\n\nLifetimes of shame and anger melted and my heart cracked wide open.\n\nRichard Rudd, the creator ofthe Gene Keys, says the fifth line\u2019s main inner work is forgiveness. It took me some time to really understand why he said that. It is because of the mechanics of the projection field.\n\nThe 5th line is on the receiving end of projection to be the hero, the savior, the one who can fix all that ails someone. Other people, often at their rock bottom, are looking for a savior and hang their hope onto the 5th line. And the 5th line will be none the wiser \u2013 it will all be projection.\n\nAnd anyone in a projection field (the 5 or the 2), cannot stop the projection from happening. Just as the one who is doing the projection can\u2019t stop it.\n\nIt is mechanical, not personal. It\u2019s all part of the karmic web we weave in this game called life.\n\nThe only thing those in a projection field can do is to be clear about what is theirs to own\/do and let the rest go. And when they do that, it creates a cascade of events that have the potential to rapidly transmute disempowered patterns of karma.\n\nAnd, whether we are conscious of it or not, letting go of what we think others should have done is what forgiveness is.\n\nBut it isn\u2019t a process we can force. It is a process of leaning into what is real and alive in any given moment. And loving ourselves through it. Even when it hurts like hell.\n\nThis is particularly important with the 5th line because, sometimes, being projected upon in \u201cincorrect\u201d ways cuts down to the soul. The fantasy breaks that you are being seen for who you really are and you discover that the other person only had what you could do for them in mind.\n\nAnd that is exactly where I was, back in 2022, when the original version of this contemplation came due.\n\nI\u2019d been on the receiving end of an incredibly painful and wildly incorrect projection. I was devastated, confused, and questioning the foundations of a long lasting relationship.\n\nBut, something about this felt different.\n\nIn the past, especially before I understood my human design profile,\u00a0 I would take these projections on by making them about me.\n\nAs a result, I became the world\u2019s biggest people pleaser. I would just accept anything ever said about me and call it fact. I let people blame me for crazy shit that had nothing to do with me and everything to do with their inability to process their own shame. I took on other people\u2019s shame, despair, and hopelessness and made it my own. I bent myself into a million different pretzels trying to make sure that no one ever felt disappointed on my watch.\n\nOver the years with HD, though, I have learned to really deeply question \u201cthe roots\u201d of what other people think, feel, and do in response to my energy.\n\nJust like I recommend my 5th linemapclients, I operate on the assumption thateverythingis a projection. And I\u2019ve put it in the realm of mechanical and karmic, rather than personal.\n\nAnd this really magical thing happens where, from that perspective, I can see what actually is mine and what is theirs. When something is mine, I take full responsibility for it and I let the rest go.\n\nIt has taken conscious effort and a metric fuck ton ofdeconditioning. And it doesn\u2019t always happen in an instant.\n\nBut this particular instant, just as Gate 4 was coming due, I crossed an important turning point.\n\nIt stung like a mother fucker. But I could also see the ridiculous nature of the projection. There was no hemming and hawing. No wondering what I\u2019d done to deserve it. And no taking on bullshit.\n\nMy feelings of anger came in strong and hot, showing me where my boundaries are and how to reconcile them.\n\nI don\u2019t take on the burden of other people\u2019s projections. I let them bounce off of me and will no longer spend hours, days, weeks, months, years ruminating on them.\n\nIn those moments, everything I had been practicing came to life in a whole new way. I just let the anger be there. I felt it, in my body, and allowed it to bring focus to what belongs to me and what doesn\u2019t.\n\nI leaned into what was real and alive.\n\nSuddenly, there was no part of me that believed the other person should have behaved differently.\n\nAnd I began to feel grateful for the incorrect projection. I reveled in the opportunity to gain deeper clarity about myself, my boundaries, and what I will and will not do.\n\nI felt compassionate gratitude that this person had zero capacity to take responsibility for themselves and their decisions. I felt grateful that they poured their disappointment onto me like hot honey.\n\nI returned it to sender and acted with a level of integrity that I am proud of.\n\nBy processing my anger and embodying its wisdom, I naturally moved into forgiveness.\n\nI literally cannot control what other people see in me and trying to doesn\u2019t just hurt me, it hurts them, too. It steals their opportunity to own and heal their shit, and my karma isn\u2019t having any of that.\n\nIn those moments, it was obvious. Forgiveness was the only logical thing left to do.\n\n## Affirmations for Human Design Gate 4\n\nUsing your Human Design to create affirmations is a powerful way to activate the full potential of your chart.

Maya is like a web that we tangle in and struggle to get out.\n\nThe maya is an essential part of the Divine game of Hide and Seek.\n\n\u201cGod likes to play hide-and-seek, but because there is nothing outside of God, he has no one but himself to play with! But he gets over this difficulty by pretending that he is not himself. This is his way of hiding from himself. He pretends that he is you and I and all the people in the world, all the animals, plants, all the rocks, and all the stars. In this way he has strange and wonderful adventures, some of which are terrible and frightening. But these are just like bad dreams, for when he wakes up they will disappear.\u201dAlan Watts,The Book: On The Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are\n\nIf you\u2019ve been in my world for more than a minute or have yourHuman Design Map, you have undoubtedly seen my references to \u201cforgetting and remembering.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe forget and remember. And we forget again.\u201dTrevor Hall, Kala, Bowl of Light\n\nAs I mention in themap, in this game of Divine Hide and Seek, we aren\u2019t supposed to stop forgetting. The real journey is in remembering. And remembering to remember.\n\nBeing human means to forget.\n\nNeptune is the place where we forget who we really are. Neptune makes this illusory game fun.\n\nFor me, with gate 5 in both of my Neptune placements, habits, routines, and rituals have been a key in playing the game.\n\nI\u2019ve fought hard to overcome a number of destructive habits.\n\nI\u2019ve stopped binge eating and drinking, drugs, sex with strangers, and people-pleasing.\n\nBTW, if you want to learn my process, step-by-step, for using spiritual alchemy to overcome habits that prevent you from remembering, I teach it in the Deconditioning Toolbox, which is included when you purchase yourHuman Design Map.\n\nAll of those habits were how I hid from myself. As I mentioned in my post aboutHuman Design Gate 24, they were all ways to escape the intense mystery of silence (24).\n\nAnd when we hide from ourselves, we step further and further away from who we really are.In keeping with gate 5 in both Neptunes, for me, it has really been a process of coming back to myself, again and again.\n\nEating, drinking, drugs, and sex have all been places where I transform illusion into clarity of my Divine I AM.At this point, I\u2019ve given up the idea that I will never engage in \u201cbad\u201d habits or struggle with creating supportive rituals and routines. I\u2019m trying to never say never, tbh.\n\nBecause even after quitting drugs, drinking, binging, and sex with strangers, I\u2019ve come to understand that habits, routines, and rituals will likely always be a gateway into transforming the maya.\n\nI\u2019m not supposed to stop forgetting. I\u2019m supposed to keep remembering.\n\nSo, I will keep using the energy of Gate 5 to help me discover more about myself, what I need to feel supported, and what helps me remember.\n\nIf you want support as you remember to remember, get yourmapand go on the journey inside themapportal.\n\n## Affirmations for Human Design Gate 5\n\nUsing your Human Design to create affirmations is a powerful way to activate the full potential of your chart.

Treat yourself the way you would a small child \u2013 with love, curiosity, and understanding.\n\n### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 6 (Gene Key 6)\n\nA while back, in my post aboutHuman Design Gate 4and forgiveness, I wrote about how contemplating the gates for these posts always arrives in such Divine timing. It is like it doesn\u2019t matter that I\u2019m updating the post a couple months before the upcoming sun transit. They land in divine timing, no matter when I\u2019m doing the writing.\n\nGate 6 is one of the gates that my \u201cdue date\u201d (to get the contemplation into my team for scheduling) comes at the perfect time.\n\nOne of my habits for these posts has been to review the material I have already written about the gate for theHuman Design Map.\n\nOne of the things that stands out for the \u201chigh frequency\u201d\u00a0 expression of Gate 6 is this:\n\nUsing your emotional clarity to know which conflicts are worth resolving and which ones aren\u2019t.\n\nIt seems so resonant because I havegate 59, line 5, defined and hanging in my unconscious mars. I go into a bit more detail about mars in thegate 59post\u00a0 but, in essence, our unconscious mars is one of our core relational wounds. And it eventually becomes our \u201cvocation.\u201d\n\n(I talk about that more in depth about vocation in the \u201cHuman Design and Business Messaging\u201d guide inside theHuman Design Mapportal. If you are a client, you can read that guidehere.)\n\nGate 59 is all about vulnerability and breaking down walls to intimacy; it is the harmonic gate to gate 6 and together, they create the channel of mating.\n\nFor a long time, as I mentioned in the gate 59 post, my primary mode of operation has been to be more and more vulnerable in the hopes of breaking down walls. And I\u2019ve done so to my detriment.\n\nI\u2019ve had countless relationships where vulnerability was not a two-way street, and, in some cases, my vulnerability was even used as a weapon against me.\n\nI started to realize that, as Brene Brown says, all people hadn\u2019t \u201cearned the right\u201d to my vulnerability. And I\u2019ve made it a conscious practice to be more discerning about who, where, and why I am vulnerable with others.\n\nWhat never dawned on me, though, until the original contemplation of gate, was the people who \u201cearn the right\u201d to my vulnerability are the people who have the capacity to take responsibility for their emotions.\n\nThey don\u2019t make it a regular habit of blaming others for their inner state of being. They are able to work through relationships chaos caused by their unconscious projections. And, they don\u2019t try to \u201cforce me\u201d to hold space for them while they process their projections of me.\n\nIn other words, they are more actively embodied in the \u201chigh frequency\u201d of gate 6 (or are at least attempting to be!).\n\nWhen I look at the relationships where I thrive, this is true every single time, and any time it isn\u2019t, the relationship goes south. I don\u2019t stay in relationships with people who aren\u2019t capable of emotional maturity on that level.\n\nAnd it has taken me a long time to accept that about myself. My undefined solar plexus is no longer willing to be the sponge and savior of other people\u2019s emotional baggage.\n\nA while back, I ended a relationship with someone because of this very thing.\n\nMy spleen said NO to further contact and I finally listened. After decades, I walked away. I was no longer going to be the villain in their emotional drama.\n\nTruth be told though, it was a hard decision, mentally, I was also holding onto the story that only horrible people end such prominent relationships. I\u2019ve thought maybe I should be even more vulnerable and open. And I\u2019ve questioned if I\u2019m really the crazy one here or if I have a right to such strong boundaries.\n\nBut, now, a year has passed since the original writing of this post and it is even clearer that my spleen really did know. It was not good for my well-being to stay in that relationship. I don\u2019t have the energy to maintain relationships with people who are in the \u201clow frequency\u201d of gate 6 and I am no longer willing to try and cultivate that energy.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t mean they are \u201cbad\u201d people. They are just humans, too.\n\nBut, I don\u2019t need to hang on, either. I\u2019ve let the guilt trip go.\n\nAs is so often said in traditional Human Design, it isn\u2019t personal \u2013 it\u2019s mechanical.\n\nSome conflicts are worth resolving. And others aren\u2019t.\n\nGood to know.\n\n## Affirmations for Human Design Gate 6\n\nUsing your Human Design to create affirmations is a powerful way to activate the full potential of your chart. Here are some affirmations for Gate 6:\n\nI create clarity and stability by honoring my emotions.\n\nI take full responsibility for my emotions and this paves the way for peaceful relationships.\n\nI am not available to take on emotional projection from others.\n\nInside yourHuman Design Map, you\u2019ll get a full list of empowering beliefs for your type + strategy, authority, profile, and all four gates of yourincarnation crossand show you how to go from affirmation to full-on embodiment.

I want to be like Oprah\u2019s mentor.\n\nBecause I didn\u2019t know anything about Human Design, I didn\u2019t know that I have the full 31\/7 channel in my design. And I certainly hadn\u2019t fully owned my natural abilities to guide and lead.\n\nBut I did know that I didn\u2019t want to be the star of the show.\n\nI wanted to be behind the scenes empowering others with the truth of their being \u2013 helping them to own their gifts, talents, and sovereign power \u2013 and making their unique contribution to the world (Human Design Gate 8).\n\nSince that sacred conversation with that coach, I\u2019ve gone on to coach, guide, and mentor people who are doing amazing things in the world.\n\nAnd nothing has delighted me more than watching someone go out into the world \u2013 taking a tiny nugget I offered them \u2013 and make pure magic with it.\n\nToday, it looks completely different than it used to because I don\u2019t do one-to-one coaching anymore. I only offer theHuman Design Map.\n\nBut I still get to witness the power of showing others how to access their innate power.

It can feel purposeless under the weight of external conditioning and pressure.\n\nYou\u2019ll learn about the surprising (but most effective) way to raise your energy frequency in theHuman Design Map + Portal.\n\nIn the meantime, start noticing when you are being inauthentic but don\u2019t be an asshole to yourself. Treat yourself the way you would a small child \u2013 with love, curiosity, and understanding.\n\n### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 8 (Gene Key 8)\n\nGate 8 is defined in my Unconscious Jupiter.\u00a0 And, true to the nature of the unconscious side of the chart, Gate 8 has been a really powerful gateway into shadow for me.\n\nOn the conscious side, Jupiter is our path to expanding into abundance, prosperity, miracles, and healing. And on the unconscious side, it reveals the primary shadows and \u201cblocks\u201d that stop the flow.\n\n(Jupiter\u2019s placements are also important in the big picture of prosperity and can be very important for business owners to understand. I have a guide insidethe map portalthat tells you what Jupiter means through that lens.)\n\nMy conscious Jupiter is inHuman Design Gate 20, which is all about being present in the now, contemplation, and expressing truth when it arises.\n\nIn other words, I create abundance, healing, and miracles in my life by being in the present moment, making space for contemplation, and sharing my intuitive wisdom when it arrives.\n\nWith Gate 8 in my unconscious Jupiter, my biggest \u201cblock\u201d to stepping into that source of abundance is misdirected rebellion and inauthenticity.\n\nThe more I can transform rebellion into authenticity, the more present I am in my life. The more present I am, sharing what I know when I know it, the more abundance I create.\n\nThese are some of my core practices for abundance and Wild Success.\n\nI\u2019ve reached a point in my life where being inauthentic creates so much bitterness that I can\u2019t do it anymore. I\u2019m done with people-pleasing, masking, and trying to make everybody and their brother happy. I want my contribution to this world to be as authentic as humanly possible and that requires me to\u2026.be authentic!That is why I practice what I preach insidethe map portal. My practice is showing up authentically, rallying my inner resources and wholeness, even when other people don\u2019t like it, have some bullshit thoughts about it, or want me to play small.\n\nOtherwise, I become a rebelwithouta cause, destroying myself and everything in my path. That way of being doesn\u2019t lead to more authenticity \u2014 it leads to less. And it wastes a metric fuck ton of energy.\n\nWhen I waste energy on false rebellions, I have little left to discover what isactuallyauthentic, what my causereallyis, and where that rebelenergy can be channeled into somethingtrulyworthwhile.\n\nAnd it fills my present moment with defensiveness, victim consciousness, and existential anguish.\n\nIn those triggered states, I don\u2019t have access to the inner wisdom that allows my Gate 20 to be present and speak its truth now.\n\nThis awareness was a bitter pill to swallow. No pun intended.\n\nI\u2019m grateful to understand how Gate 8\u2019s \u201clow\u201d frequency manifests in my life. That awareness, coupled with meeting those parts of myself with radical self-acceptance and unconditional love, has helped me transform rebellion into authentic contribution. Now, rebellion is simply a clue letting me know that a part of me believes that I must comply, and I know exactly how to handle that.\n\nOf course, I can\u2019t say, with any self-respect, that I am never rebellious for rebellion\u2019s sake. That just isn\u2019t true. Healing people pleasing is like peeling an onion. As one of the big layers is peeled off, smaller, more nuanced layers appear. The journey is about going deeper and deeper into the same shit.\n\nIt is all an opportunity to get curious, to notice how present I am, and where I might be getting caught in the victim mindset, looking for where to lay blame.\n\nRinse. Repeat.\n\nIf you want to understand more about the unique contribution that you are here to make, be sure to get yourHuman Design Map.\n\n## Affirmations for Human Design Gate 8\n\nUsing your Human Design to create affirmations is a powerful way to activate the full potential of your chart.

I can quickly lose interest and need to consciously reconcile the big picture with the little picture.\n\nAs a business owner, that has presented some challenges!\n\nMy business and theHuman Design Mapare here to help you gain unforgettable clarity to live into your value and higher purpose. I show you \u2013 step-by-step \u2013 how to heal the emotional and spiritualshadowsthat \u201cblock\u201d your authentic expression. When youtruly recognize and invite my guidance, I can guide you fromknowingyour Human Design design tohaving embodied experiencesof it\u2019s highest expression and purpose.\n\nWhen it comes to guiding people on their inner journey, I\u2019m great. I can get to the heart of the matter \u2013 fast \u2013 and I blend Human Design mechanics with spiritual alchemy like no other.\n\nBut making sure thatone little checkboxis ticked in my tech stack isn\u2019t exactly where I shine.\n\nAnd, withHuman Design Gate 54in my midheaven, I\u2019m here for it. I\u2019ve embraced the idea that I am here to embody earth-bound prosperity as a critical part of my spiritual path.\n\nSo, the gate 9 details have becomegrist for the mill.\n\nWhat I\u2019ve come to discover is that the gate 9 kind of details are actually mirrors for healing and transformation.\u00a0 Instead of pushing against them, being mad that I have to pay attention to them, or blowing them off all together, its apparent that the best path forward is to fully process feelings of shame that come up when I think I\u2019m fucking everything up.\n\nAnd probably more importantly, over time, it has become more and more obvious that I\u2019m not supposed to do it alone.\n\nBuilding a team has brought all of this into even greater clarity. I\u2019ve had the deep honor of receiving help from some amazing people. By letting them shine in what they are genius at, I don\u2019t have to be so focused on the parts that I\u2019m not designed for.\n\nI\u2019ve even had the pleasure of having a team member with the full 9-52 channeldefined.\n\nAnd holy mother of all that is. What a mirror! To see the gate 9 details revealed with such mastery is a sight to behold. It has shown me so clearly that I don\u2019t have to be so ruggedly independent.\n\nThere really are people that can help and do what I\u2019ve been trying to do at least 79 billion times better than I ever could. \ud83e\udd2f\n\nAnd another person with the channel 12-22definedhas revealed so much about handling mistakes with so much grace. I really don\u2019t have to be so hard on myself.\n\nJust like I teach mymapclients, healing and transformation can only happen when we drop the judgment and self-criticism. Yes, being honest with ourselves is key. But we must do it with compassion, curiosity, and Grace. Those are the keys that unlock the heart of alchemical transformation.\n\n(I deep dive on all channels AND alchemical transformation inside the Human Design Map portal.Get yours here.)\n\nUnderstanding how we treat ourselves in the face of ourundefinedaspects is everything. We can be so fucking mean to ourselves about the supposedly inadequacies.\n\nBut when we lean into them and allow them topolish the mirror, they show us so much about what it means to be human.

Treat yourself the way you would a small child \u2013 with love, curiosity, and understanding.\n\n### My Personal Experience with Human Design Gate 10 (Gene Key 10)\n\nSelf-love was a foreign concept to me until my early thirties.\n\nWhen I first came across the idea, like so many, I was confused and needed clarification about what it even means to love oneself.\n\nFirst and foremost, I thought that self-love was undoubtedly selfish. I\u2019d been conditioned to believe that ignoring my own needs and taking care of others (especially emotionally) was how I earned Gold Stars from \u201cGod.\u201d\n\nI also thought self-love meant I was conceited, full of myself, or completely narcissistic.\n\nAnd, I was at a breaking point.\n\nI had recently started my business and naively assumed that being in charge of my schedule would somehow magically make my life a land of fairy tales.\n\nAnd, don\u2019t get me wrong, there is no part of me that wants to go back to working for other people. I\u2019m unemployable, at this point.\n\nBut, just like so many of the people who are drawn to my work with themap, I still believed that the answers were outside of me. I was convinced that a change in outer circumstances would fix everything that seemed broken.\n\nI woke up to the realization that the answers are \u2013 and always have been \u2013 inside of me. And learning to love and accept myself was the way.\n\nI knew that if I were to grow into my authenticity and step into my higher purpose, self-love was my next step. There was no other way around it. The way I was living was not working.\n\nLet\u2019s be honest.\n\nYou don\u2019t end up addicted to drugs, alcohol, and sex with strangers because you love yourself, right?\n\nNo. You don\u2019t.\n\nSo, I decided to believe all those inspirational quotes about putting on my oxygen mask first and decided that I would learn to love myself.\n\nBut that was when the \u201creal block\u201d to self-love showed up.\n\nI thought that deciding to love myself would be like waving a magic wand; in a flash, my self-hatred, unhealthy habits (human design gate 5), and shitty boundaries (human design gate 37) would disappear into thin air.\n\nAnd, I assure you, if I had such a wand, I\u2019d sell it on the internet for millions of dollars. LOL.\n\nHowever, it doesn\u2019t work like that. And it isn\u2019t supposed to.\n\nIn this game of Divine Hide and Seek, we are being called into ourselves. And anytime we areseekingoutside of ourselves for answers, the answers will keephiding.\n\nIn reality, self-love is about devotion to your inner knowing. It\u2019s a practice that gets really messy and requires the tenacity to keep choosing self-love, even when all of the odds are stacked against you.\n\nSelf-love is a path of understanding yourself, your needs, your values, and your heartfelt desires and healing the \u201cblocks\u201d that prevent you from prioritizing those things in your life.\n\nAs you likely already know, yourHuman Design chartis a beautiful doorway into discovering what it means to love yourself. I would even go so far as to say Human Design is a shortcut!\n\n(You\u2019re in luck. I\u2019m a literal master at teaching you how to \u201cheal your blocks.\u201d In theHuman Design Map, I\u2019ll explain the most important parts of your design and teach you how to love yourself, even when life is handing you a shit sandwich inside the Human Design Map + Portal.Get your access here.)\n\nWhether you use your Human Design as part of your journey into self-love, rest assured that it takes forgiveness, acceptance, patience, and radical honesty with yourself and others.\n\nMore importantly, it means you have to let people think whatever they want about you. Even if they think you are selfish, conceited, or full of yourself.\n\n\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\n\nWhat other people think about you is none of your business.\n\nAs we move into the era of individual empowerment and the embodiment of spirit (2027 \u2013 2438), it is essential to remember that other people\u2019s thoughts, feelings, and actions are their own. And that their judgments of you areprojectionsof their own disintegratedshadows.\n\nYour fear of other people thinking \u201cnegative\u201d things about you, and judging the shit out of yourself because of it, are the \u201cblocks\u201d to unshakable self love.\n\nThe energy you need to move forward with self-love is bound up in those fears. And reclaiming those lost parts of yourself is where you find your freedom.\n\nEvery single time.\n\nWhen you do what is right for you, no matter what other people think\u2026\n\n\u2026 Self-hatred transforms into self-respect\u2026\n\n\u2026Unhealthy habits alchemize into conscious and higher alignment choices\u2026\n\n\u2026Shitty boundaries transform into honesty and integrity.\n\nThis magical combination of energy allows self-love to permeate the essence of your being, and you become a lighthouse that empowers others to do the same. It is gate 10 in action.\n\nI\u2019ll teach you \u201chow\u201d inside theHuman Design Map + Portal.\n\nOn my own path, for which there are still plenty of miles to go, I\u2019ve discovered that the more I practice self-love, the more I say yes to myself, and the more I create the space necessary for self-understanding, the more fun and meaningful my life is.\n\nAnd ironically enough, the more I love myself, the easier it is for me to show up for others. By giving from the overflow of my full cup, I can be in genuine service without the bitterness and resentment that filled my earlier years.\n\nI now trust that the more I give myself, the more I have to give to others. And that what other people think about my path is about them.\n\nIt can only be that way.\n\n## Affirmations for Human Design Gate 10\n\nUsing your Human Design to create affirmations is a powerful way to activate the full potential of your chart. Here are some affirmations for Gate 10:\n\nI love myself fully and completely.\n\nI am an example of radical self love.\n\nI am empowered by knowing and honoring what I need.\n\nInside yourHuman Design Map, you\u2019ll get a full list of empowering beliefs for your type + strategy, authority, profile, and all four gates of yourincarnation crossand show you how to go from affirmation to full-on embodiment.

Treat yourself the way you would a small child \u2013 with love, curiosity, and understanding.\n\n### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 11 (Gene Key 11)\n\nGate 11 is especially interesting to me.\n\nIt isundefinedin my chart, but I haveHuman Design Gate 56hanging in mydefinedthroat. And, probably more importantly, I have a small split between my ajna and throat; gates17,23, or 11 will bridge that split.\n\nI talk about splits inside the Nine Centers Guide, which is inside theHuman Design Mapportal. But, essentially, a small split means that you only have one gate that will transform your chart from split definition to single definition. That means that gate 11 is a highly electromagnetic gate for me and, as with anyundefined places in our charts, is a place where I\u2019ve been gathering wisdom my whole life. It has shown me a lot about how our imagination plays such an important role in the stories we tell (56).\n\nOften, we think that our imagination (11) and stories (56) are \u201cthe truth.\u201d\n\nAnd with my defined head and ajna (via the channel of awareness61\u201324), I\u2019ve been wrestling with the concept of Truth my whole life. \u201cTruth\u201d is a deeply subjective part of this mystery called life.\n\nRecognizing that Truth is subjective brings me the most peace of mind. No oneknowshow we got here, why we came, and what happens when we die.\n\nThe only thing we ever really have is our inner wisdom and sense of resonance, and choosing to trust leads us to our growth edge.\n\nWe can choose to believe in our inner Truth. Or we can choose to believe in our conditioning.\n\nWhile it can hurt to realize it initially, it\u2019s all a choice.\n\nYour thoughts, beliefs, ideas, opinions, and yes, even your \u201cTruth\u201d is 100% optional. The sentences in your mind aren\u2019t set in stone \u2013 they are malleable like clay.\n\nAnd when we are caught up in our stories (gate 56), especially the \u201cnegative\u201d ones, it clouds our ability to make peace with other people having a different Truth. And this can destroy our relationships.\n\n(Inside theHuman Design MapPortal, I have a quick and dirty guide on decoding Human Design relationship charts. If you are a map customer, the guide is in the section called \u201cQuick and Dirty Guides\u201d.)\n\nFor most of my life, I held a story (gate 56) that belonging was dependent on shared beliefs and values. I used to believe that to \u201cget along\u201d with people, we had to think and believe the same things. And that if we disagreed, then it was a recipe for trouble in the relationship.\n\nAnytime there was even a semblance of disagreement, I would whip up far-out scenarios in my imagination. I would visualize the worst possible outcome and weave doom and gloom stories.\n\nA self fulfilling prophecy.\n\nWhat I\u2019ve come to understand, though, is that differences are NOT the problem. It is the attachment to \u201cTruth\u201d that is the real troublemaker.\n\nWhen we are attached to something, we depend on it to create our feelings and emotions. And when that thing isn\u2019t there, we spiral into hopelessness, despair, fear, and shame.\n\nWhen we need other people to agree with us, we depend on their agreement to feel safe, secure, whole, or worthy.\n\nThat attachment is a 100% faulty foundation for relationships. If your feelings depend on how other people think, feel, and align with your beliefs and ideals, you are truly up shit\u2019s creek.\n\nAttachment cannot build growth and expansion \u2013 it will crumble.\n\nWe are moving into the era of individual empowerment (2027 \u2013 2438), it is time for our foundations to be built upon \u201cthe truth\u201d of\u00a0 inner wisdom and resonance. And in letting go of the attachment to how our individual \u201ctruth\u201d lands with others.\n\nTo begin using our imagination (11) to weave up stories (gate 56) about empowered relationships that thrive when each individual is empowered.\n\nNo doubt, life will invite you, time and time again, to make peace with not reallyknowing. And, in doing so, we make space for a new vision beyond our wildest imagination.\n\n\u201cSpillin\u2019 out like waterLike a mountain gave a daughterSurrender never felt so goodI grew it strong like a sacred woodAnd now the roots are running deeperAll illusion getting weakerYou see, the wisdom it don\u2019t come from readingIt comes from believingWhat I know, is that I don\u2019t knowAnd now I dance and I sing and I live fullI give it all to the call of the unknownAho\u201d\n\nTrevor Hall, The Fruitful Darkness, What I Know (on SpotifyORlive in concert on youtube)\n\nThe growth edge is in exploring the attachments and letting them go, piece by piece, and building a foundation of belief and faith simply because you trust yourself.\n\nIn that space, the mind becomes a fun playground of imagination, curiosity, and awe rather than a boulder weighing you down.\n\nMagick.\n\nIf you want to learn \u201cthe how\u201d, grab yourmapand go on the journey inside themapportal.\n\n## Affirmations for Human Design Gate 11\n\nUsing your Human Design to create affirmations is a powerful way to activate the full potential of your chart. Here are some affirmations for Gate 11:\n\nI have a rich and rewarding imagination.\n\nI pour my ideas into art.\n\nVisualization is my medicine.\n\nInside yourHuman Design Map, you\u2019ll get a full list of empowering beliefs for your type + strategy, authority, profile, and all four gates of yourincarnation crossand show you how to go from affirmation to full-on embodiment. In the meantime, be sure to also check out my post onhow to make Human Design affirmations work.\n\n### Now it\u2019s your turn to contemplate Gate 11\n\nWhen you stand in the truth that the gifts of gate 11 are available to you, whether you have it in your chart or not\u2026\n\nRight now, in this moment, what is your Truth?\n\nWhen you think about the possibility of your Truth being wrong, what feelings come up for you?\n\nIn what ways do you need others to agree with you?\n\nIn what ways are you attached to your beliefs, thoughts, and ideas?\n\nWhat feelings underlie your attachments to your Truth?\n\nHow can you create those feelings for yourself without being dependent on external sources?\n\nMy hope is that you will make some space to really reflect on these questions and let your Truth rise to the surface. And in that, you will find healing, strength, and power to live your Truth.\n\nI encourage you to take some time with these questions. Take them out into your world and let their answers reveal themselves to you.

Gate 12 wants nothing more than to pour everything it has into art and share it with the world. It has \u201cgood taste\u201d and idealistic visions of beauty, art, andGrace.\n\nOn the \u201cnegative\u201d end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 12 is the energy for holding people, organizations, and art to impossible standards of perfection. It can easily push other people\u2019s buttons with its words and can even have a bit of a superiority complex because of its highly refined \u201cpalate\u201d in life.\n\nYou\u2019ll learn about the surprising (but most effective) way to raise your energy frequency in theHuman Design Map + Portal.\n\nIn the meantime, start noticing when you are using words as weapons but don\u2019t be an asshole to yourself. Treat yourself the way you would a small child \u2013 with love, curiosity, and understanding.\n\n### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 12 (Gene Key 12)\n\nGate 12 is undefined in my chart, but it\u2019s one of the ones I find myself contemplating again and again. Like all of Human Design, what keeps me coming back isn\u2019t just the mechanics \u2014 it\u2019s the golden threads between the correspondences that create the puzzle we call the bodygraph.\n\nSome of the correspondences for Gate 12 are that it\u2019s in Gemini, which is ruled by Mercury and is mutable. It\u2019s in the throat center in the Human Design chart. And because it connects to a motor center, the solar plexus, via Gate 22, it\u2019s a \u201cmanifesting\u201d gate.\n\nLet\u2019s break that down.\n\n### Gemini, Ruled By Mercury\n\nI\u2019ve talked before about how most of the throat gates are in Gemini. And it tracks, right?\n\nGemini is Mercury\u2019s domain. Mercury was the God of Commerce. He loaded up his metaphorical cart and brought valuable goods to the market. But more than simply delivering them, hecommunicatedtheir value. He shaped perception. He told the story of why they mattered.\n\nAnd even deeper than that, he was a shapeshifter. A trickster. A poet. A magician. He moved between worlds, translated meaning, and cloaked deep truths in metaphor so they could be received by the hearts that needed them.\n\nLanguage was more than expression. It was his tool of transmission. It was how he manifested.\n\n### The Throat Center & Manifesting in Human Design\n\nIn Human Design, the throat is where manifestation happens. But, true to the mercurial roots of the throat, manifesting isn\u2019t about vision boards and good vibes.\n\nWhen we are talking about manifesting in Human Design, we are talking about how energy moves from the head, ajna, will, spleen, G, heart, sacral, root, and solar plexus. The energy on the inside of the body is moving out into the world.\n\nA very, very (probably over simplified example) is crying.\n\nCrying is sadness made visible. You can now touch the sadness with your hands. It becomes more than a sensation in the body, it becomes the sound of sobs, the taste of salt, and ruins your mascara.\n\nThat energy expressing itself in the \u201creal\u201d world is manifestation in Human design.\n\n(\u2728Side note: If you\u2019re a Manifestor or Manifesting Generator, I talk more about this in yourHuman Design Map.)\n\nWhether through words, actions, deeds, or \u201cart,\u201d most of the energy manifesting through the throat communicates to the world who you are and what you are about. It\u2019s Mercury\u2019s way of loading up your metaphorical cart and \u201cmarketing\u201d it to the world.\n\n### What Does That Have To Do With Gate 12?\n\nIn case you didn\u2019t know, Gate 12 has gone through a few name changes in theHuman Design Map. It started asThe Poet. ThenThe Fine Artist. The most recent change wasThe Artisan of Life.\n\nBut that evolution wasn\u2019t about me changing my mind.\n\nIt was me listening to what Mercury was telling me, straight out of the mouths of mymapclients.\n\nPeople with Gate 12 defined \u2014 even in their incarnation cross \u2014 would say things like:\n\nBut I\u2019m not a poet.\n\nI don\u2019t make art. I don\u2019t even really like it.\n\nI\u2019m terrible with words. I actually don\u2019t talk much.\n\nAnd my Gemini Moon (in Gate 16, naturally)was nothaving that. Because I knew that it meant my words \u2013 my communication \u2013 weren\u2019t landing.\n\nThey were putting people in unnecessary boxes. Perhaps even perpetuating the very people pleasing, pretending, and putting words in their mouths. And when that happens, your energy gets misdirected and cannot \u201cmanifest\u201d in its most potent, purposeful form.\n\nAnd that is the last thing I want to contribute to.\n\nI\u2019m all about liberating you from all the ways in which you sacrifice your integrity for the fruitless venture of \u201cmaking\u201d other people happy. And teaching you the skills necessary to leverage and channel your energy in ways that leave you satisfied, successful, peaceful, and delightfully surprised by the magick of life.\n\n(That\u2019s the deeper work we do in theMap and Portal\u2014 not just naming energies, but helping you direct them toward what\u2019s actually authentic to you.)\n\nSo, when the words don\u2019t land, and you don\u2019t feel seen, it\u2019s time for me to listen even more deeply. And to put my ego aside to make the chart even more applicable in the lives of people living real-world lives everyday.\n\nAnd as Mercury spoke, I heard:\n\nGate 12 is movement.And movement is art.And art is life, made manifest.\n\nYes, sometimes it will look literal \u2014 painting, poetry, dance, whatever. Things you can touch, taste, smell, and see.\n\nBut maybe it is more about making your life your greatest work of art. It\u2019s about being discerning in how you move and letting it be true to what is actually inside of you \u2014 instead of moving in ways that others have conditioned you to move.\n\nMaybe, just maybe, it\u2019s Mercury doing what Mercury does best.\n\nAs he shape-shifts, he tells us that it doesn\u2019t matter what we say or do on the outside. Because energy does not lie.\n\nWhat matters is the inner energy that drives the expression\u2014the energy being communicated, the value being exchanged, and the transformative lesson wrapped in the metaphor of being human.\n\nOnly time will tell ifThe Artisan of Lifewill be the archetypal name that sticks.\n\nBut what I know for sure is that Mercury has his ways. And that, even when it doesn\u2019t seem like it on the outside, life always moves us towards expanding our capacity for authenticity, purpose, Grace, and expression.\n\nThis life, the one we are living here and now, is our Masterpiece.\n\nMessage received, Mercury. Message received.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re ready to hear the call of your soul so loud and clear that you cannot unsee its wisdom and truth,invite me here.\n\n## Affirmations for Human Design Gate 12\n\nUsing your Human Design to create affirmations is a powerful way to activate the full potential of your chart. Here are some affirmations for Gate 12:\n\nI transform my emotions into poetry and art.\n\nMy life is my art.\n\nI have impeccable taste.\n\nInside yourHuman Design Map, you\u2019ll get a full list of empowering beliefs for your type + strategy, authority, profile, and all four gates of yourincarnation crossand show you how to go from affirmation to full-on embodiment.

Treat yourself the way you would a small child \u2013 with love, curiosity, and understanding.\n\n### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 13 (Gene Key 13)\n\nGate 13 undefined in my chart, but interestingly enough, it is connected to recognizing my gifts with theHuman Design system.\n\nAs a5\/2 profile, I\u2019m in the \u201cdouble projection field,\u201d which essentially means that people don\u2019t see me \u2013 they see the projection of their hopes, dreams, and expectations. And an essential part of mykarmic roleis to be able to \u201ccall myself out\u201d on my natural gifts and use them accordingly. Otherwise, I waste all of my energy on trying to live up to othersprojections.\n\nAnd, depending on how long you\u2019ve been in my orbit, you may not know that I came to Human Design kicking and screaming. I didn\u2019t plan on Human Design being a part of my energy healing business and definitely had no idea that it would eventually become the \u201cface\u201d of my business.\u00a0It took me a minute to see that I have something unique to say in the Human Design space.\n\nIn hindsight, I realize that, like so many otherprojector types, I was deeply resistant to being seen, recognized, and invited in natural and easy ways. Due to decades of conditioning, I was deeply attached to the story that it was hard and complicated to be successful.\n\nMany synchronicities helped medeconditionresistance to ease, but one of them was connected to gate 13.\u00a0(Be sure to also read my post onHuman Design gate 15, which tells the story the started it all.)\n\nI was listening to some music on Spotify and felt the heavy weight of the lyrics. I could sense the burden of being a keeper of the secrets and not knowing what to do with the betrayal, lies, and shame.\n\nThe thought popped into my head:\n\nThis song sounds like gate 13.\n\nThat may not be surprising if you\u2019ve come to know me because of my depth of knowledge (and sheer fascination) with thehuman design gates. Today, I can rattle off endless information about every gate in the chart. I can tell you all of its mechanical details, wax poetic about the beauty of its full spectrum, and tell you what it means in different placements.\n\n(Inside theHuman Design Mapportal, there are all sorts of fun ways we work with gates and channels, including business, relationships, and transits.)\n\nBut, at that time, I couldn\u2019t tell you much about them \u2013 not even the ones in my own chart.\n\nSo, being the Human Design stalker I am, I looked up the artists\u2019 birth information, ran their chart, and saw gate 13 in their conscious sun.\n\nLooking at that chart, I had a moment of calling myself out.\u00a0Through the mystery of Grace, the gates were seemingly hard coded into my cells. I could hear them speak.\n\nUntil then, I\u2019d had multiple moments when looking at charts where I could see that I had a unique understanding of energy. And that Human Design gives me a shortcut because now I have language for expressing what I always intuitively knew.\n\nBut, this moment was different because of its precision (shout out togate 62in my unconscious sun ;)).\n\nIt was crystal clear that I have a special connection with Human Design, and gate 13 was working its magick on me.\n\nIt was like I\u2019d whispered into the ears of the Universe and told it that I was ready. I would no longer hold shame about the \u201cwoo-woo\u201d nature of my gifts, the illogical way that I know things, and, most importantly, I began forgiving myself for waiting this long to claim my genius.\n\nFrom there, I\u2019ve gone on to create wild, wild success.\n\nEvery day, with theHuman Design Map + Portal, my blog,substack, and emails, I help others understand and own their genius. I help them stand boldly in who they are and to clear the \u201cblocks\u201d that get in the way of their higher purpose. It blows my mind constantly.\n\nBut that is the beauty of\u2026\n\n\u2026.having your secrets held with unconditional love and forgiveness.\n\n\u2026being able to stand vulnerable before a listening ear and knowing it will all be OK.\n\n\u2026giving voice to your deepest, most intimate parts and trusting that it will be met with empathy and Grace.\n\nThat is what happened for me that day. And I will never forget it.\n\n## Affirmations for Human Design Gate 13\n\nUsing your Human Design to create affirmations is a powerful way to activate the full potential of your chart. Here are some affirmations for Gate 13:\n\nI listen deeply with empathy.\n\nI trust that forgiveness is possible.\n\nI let go of the things that do not serve me or the collective.\n\nInside yourHuman Design Map, you\u2019ll get a full list of empowering beliefs for your type + strategy, authority, profile, and all four gates of yourincarnation crossand show you how to go from affirmation to full-on embodiment.

Treat yourself the way you would a small child \u2013 with love, curiosity, and understanding.\n\n### My Personal Experience with Human Design Gate 14 (Gene Key 14)\n\nGate 14 isundefinedin my chart and as aProjector aura type, so is mysacral center.\n\nWhen I am unconscious of my energy boundaries, I can easily get caught up in the sacral energy of the people around me and amplify it.\u00a0And, let me tell you, when someone is on the \u201chigh\u201d end of thespectrum, that experience is amazing. But when they are on the \u201clow\u201d end, not so much.\n\nMy experience is that, as a society, most people are on the low end of the gate 14 spectrum. There is so, so, so much bound up in our relationship to money. Money, while originally intended as an easy way to exchange value, has become synonymous with safety, security, and sustenance.\n\nWhich means that, collectively, in an attempt to stay safe, secure, and fed, we have tucked our purpose away and are exchanging the precious moments of our lives for money. And, on the flip side of that, we are also told that money can\u2019t buy happiness or that it isn\u2019t \u201cspiritual\u201d to want money.\n\nI get messages to those effects in theHuman Design Mapportal all the time.\n\nMoney seems to be a huge point of contention when learning to trust ourselves and becoming more authentic in our lives.\u00a0We \u201cneed\u201d the money and we deeply believe that staying where we are is the safest thing to do. And we beat ourselves up \u2013 feeling selfish, guilty, and unevolved \u2013 for even caring about it\n\nIt\u2019s tricky. Nuanced. And feels incredibly complex. Maybe even hopeless.\n\nI get it.\n\nI was raised in poverty, scarcity, and lack. It\u2019s like the stress of it is encoded into my cells. And, yet, I was also raised to believe that money was the root of all evil and that wanting more money proved I was a \u201cbad\u201d person (in the eyes of God).\n\nAnd I\u2019ve felt those same conflicted feelings. I\u2019ve desperately needed more money to pay my bills. While simultaneously feeling shameful for believing that money would solve all my problems.\n\nI\u2019ve heard similar stories inside themapportal as well. People tell me things like:\n\n- There isn\u2019t a way to make money doing what I love.\n\n- I have to be responsible. If I did what I love, I\u2019d be broke.\n\n- I don\u2019t want to prioritize making money over my authenticity but I do. And I hate it.\n\nSome people are even drawn into Human Design from the false promise that \u201cliving your design\u201d will make you rich. Which is so ironic because Ra Uru Hu, the original channeler of theHuman Design System, taught that the we make money through our not self.\n\nPersonally, I don\u2019t subscribe to either of those beliefs. The whole concept of \u201cliving your design\u201d is marketing. Period. And the idea that we can only make money through thenot selfis simplya projectionof the spiritual idea that money is evil.\n\nLike I said before, it\u2019s complicated. There are markers in theHuman Design chartthat can help us explore our relationship to money. And it also offers us insights and tools for becoming more authentic.\n\nBut, ultimately, creating prosperity begins with being radically honest with ourselves about our internal patterns with money and work. It\u2019s about looking at our:\n\n- values and how aligned our financial habits of earning, spending, and investing are with those values\n\n- sense of self worth and owning the value we bring to \u201cthe market.\u201d\n\n- capacity for expansion and receiving. Does it feel safe to experience true abundance?\n\n- resourcefulness and trusting ourselves to tap into it, no matter the bottom line.\n\n- level of responsibility for our outcomes and willingness to let go of blame.\n\n- relationship with pressure and how discerning we are in leveraging it correctly.\n\n- where we have unconscious internalized oppression and our relationship with power\n\n- codependency and hanging our hopes on a savior.\n\n- faith, trust, and belief.\n\nAnd, probably some things I\u2019m not even aware of. But, what i know for sure is that as we explore and find Truth, making a change is necessary. Even if it is teeny tiny.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to burn your whole life down.

Gate 15 believes every living being on the planet is worthy of love and acceptance and has the remarkable ability to unconditionally love humans\u2019 diverse natures.\n\nOn the \u201cnegative\u201d end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 15 is the energy for seeking extremes to avoid the dullness of life. It is unable to slow down and find a consistent rhythm. It may also shut down due to conventional rules or societal pressure to be like everyone else.\n\nYou\u2019ll learn about the surprising (but most effective) way to raise your energy frequency in theHuman Design Map + Portal.\n\nIn the meantime, start noticing when you are being inauthentic or not finding your flow but don\u2019t be an asshole to yourself. Treat yourself the way you would a small child \u2013 with love, curiosity, and understanding.\n\n### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 15 (Gene Key 15)\n\nAs a writer who tells many personal stories, I aim to balance sharing what is true for me and the truth that all stories aren\u2019t mine to tell.\n\nFinding this balance seems the trickiest when I\u2019ve had a profound revelation involving someone who either cannot speak for themselves or who, for various reasons, doesn\u2019t want their side of the story told.\n\nThis particular story is a combination of all of those things.\n\nIt\u2019s a story that symbolizes one of the most healing insights I\u2019ve ever been blessed to receive. It is a story that I know must be told.\n\nLet\u2019s start at the beginning.\n\nWithHuman Design Gate 28in my chart 4 times, my life has been riddled with the existential fear that my life has no meaning or purpose, and healing that story is one of the key drivers in what I do inside the\u200bHuman Design Map & Portal\u200b.\n\nA therapist once told me that people with stories like mine jump off of bridges. An astrologer told me she\u2019d need a stiff drink to read my chart. A Human Design \u201cintuitive\u201d once told me I should give up on making money, file for unemployment, and play video games for the rest of my life.\n\nSo, to say that I\u2019ve experienced a lot of trauma would be an understatement. I\u2019ve been shocked and shaken to my core more times than I can count (Human Design Gate 51 in my Conscious Earth). And I\u2019ve wallowed in seemingly needless suffering for as long as I can remember.\n\nI often look back on my life and cannot believe it\u2019s only been one lifetime. And I\u2019m no stranger to wondering how I will ever keep going.\n\nAll along the way, I\u2019ve searched for my purpose and deeply doubted my ability to make a difference in the world.\n\n\u200bEven after over a decade of receiving mind-blowing praise \u2014 clients who\u2019ve said I\u2019m a miracle worker, or that I\u2019ve made lifetimes of self-doubt disappear into thin air, or that they finally know what it feels like to experience their innate wholeness \u2014 I never really believed that I had anything to offer.\n\n\u200bAnd then, at the end of April 2020, I got one of the covetedProjector Invitations.\n\nAt that point, I was deep into my personal experiment with Human Design. I had been having many behind-the-scenes conversations with my colleagues, friends, and private clients, but I had zero intentions of doing anything \u201cofficial\u201d with it in my business. And I definitely had no idea of the wild success I\u2019d experience with the\u200bHuman Design Map & Portal\u200b.\n\nAt that time, I did private coaching for creatives who struggled with shame, self-worth, and feeling \u201cnot good enough.\u201d\n\nBut, true to myprojector aura, people started asking me if they could pay me to interpret their Human Design.\n\nAnd I kept saying no.\n\nAt that time, a part of me still believed that making money had to be much harder. That part of me thought that because Human Design came so naturally and easily to me\u2014to the point that it seemed like \u201ceveryone understands this already\u201d\u2014it had no value in the real world.\n\nBut on that fateful Thursday, April 30, 2020, someone I love and deeply respect metaphorically knocked me upside the head and insisted that I let her give me money to make the first\u200bHuman Design Map\u200b.\n\nI sent her an invoice, she paid it instantly, and on Saturday, May 2, I got to work on her\u200bmap\u200b.\n\nAs I sat there, surrounded by myHuman Design and Gene Keys books, highlighters, pencils, and my dot grid notebook, I began writing about her incarnation cross, and tears were streaming down my face.\n\nI translated Human Design\u2019s harsh and often disempowering language into pure, empowering magic.\n\nI had no idea how I was doing it. It was just burning through me like aHoly Fire.\n\nSomething inside me came alive \u2013 something I had never known was there.\n\nWith no exaggeration, I say that for the first time in my life, I KNEW I had something to offer the world.\n\nWith every fiber of my being, I knew what I was doing meant something. And I knew that everyone on the planet deserved to see themselves in the light of Grace and that, by the great mystery of all that is, that light was shining through me.\n\nA fire was lit inside of me. And I could not wait for Monday to come. This profound sense of purpose changed everything for me.\n\nAnd then, my world flipped upside down.\n\nThe next morning, May 3, 2020, withbooksand pens still strewn across my desk, I woke up to missed calls from my sister and a text message saying to call her ASAP.\n\nMy heart sank.\n\nShe picked up the phone, and she said:\n\nBryan passed away last night.\n\nI said:\n\nWait, is this really happening?\n\nIt was not computing in my brain.\n\nSee, Bryan was one of my younger brothers. And my other younger brother, Ronnie, had also tragically died many years before. And my brain did not want to accept that I\u2019d lost not just one younger brother but two.\n\nBut, it was true. I wasn\u2019t dreaming. Under more tragic circumstances, Bryan was gone.\n\nHe was 37 years old and left behind a wife and two daughters.\n\nI immediately began packing my things and headed to North Carolina to be with my family.\n\nJust over a week later, we held Bryan\u2019s funeral right next to Ronnie\u2019s grave.\n\nA couple of hundred people were there, many of whom I had never met.\n\nI listened closely as so many of them honored him by sharing the impact that he\u2019d made on their lives.\n\nTime and time again, they said the same thing about him. They said:\n\nBryan was full of heart.\n\nAnd he was.\n\nI didn\u2019t know it then, but Bryan had gate 15 in his conscious sun.\n\nHis energy was big. And bold. And you could hear him coming from a mile away.\n\nHe gave zero fucks about what other people thought he should do with his life, and he loved hard.\n\nOn that day, it was palpable. He was a Vessel of Love, and he\u2019d left exactly that mark on the world.\n\nBut this story doesn\u2019t end there.\n\nThere was also a sharp contrast between what was being said in those mini-eulogies and the whispers among the crowd.\n\nJust as people shared that Bryan had had a profound and healing impact on their lives, many well-meaning people wondered if Bryan was in Hell\u2014as in, burning for eternity with the \u201cdevil.\u201d\n\nOn the outside, Bryan lived the kind of life many people would not (and did not) approve of. Those parts of the story are not mine to tell. But, I will say that he was often seen as doing life wrong.\n\nAnd while I don\u2019t believe in Hell or eternal damnation, I, too, had been guilty of judging the way that Bryan lived his life. Until his funeral, I would have never looked at his life and said that he was someone who was living his purpose. A big part of me absolutely believed that he should be doing things differently.\n\nBut I also knew that those people who shared about his big heart were right. His life was a mess, AND he was Love walking.\n\nMan, I miss his hugs.\n\nIn the contrast, I could see that he was the embodiment of the BOTH\/AND.\n\nWhen I returned home, I ran his Human Design chart for the first time; it truly stunned me.\n\nIn his chart, his G center and Will center are defined, which combined are the heart chakra in the Hindu chakra system.\n\nAnd with Gate 15 in his conscious sun, his incarnation cross was the Vessel of Love.\n\nBryan was, in fact, full of heart.\n\nLooking at that chart, a deep peace washed over me.\n\nThe part of me that had longed for purpose and meaning my whole life surrendered to this knowing:\n\nBryan was living his purpose.\n\nMaybe it didn\u2019t look like it on the outside.\n\nBut he was. And he always was. There was never a time he wasn\u2019t.\n\nEven when he was doing things we often believed he shouldn\u2019t.\n\nBryan was living his purpose.\n\nEverything I\u2019d believed about purpose shattered. In a flash, the story was completely rewritten.\n\nPurpose isn\u2019t something that we find. It isn\u2019t something that happens to a select few. It isn\u2019t something we have to strive for, achieve, or prove in an attempt to earn worthiness on this Earth. It isn\u2019t even about what we are doing for other people.\n\nOur purpose is to live life \u2014 as ourselves with our conscious sun as our north star \u2014 and our real work is to recognize it; to accept the Divine Invitation. It is to open our hearts and minds and to expand our capacity to receive the bounty of who we really are. It is to allow ourselves to revel in the magic that flows through each and every one of us. To know that there is nothing to prove, earn, or be to be worthy of Love and Grace.\n\nWe are LOVE walking already.\n\n\u200bAs my heart cracked open, I knew I needed to tell everyone who would listen that you could end your quest to \u201cfind\u201d your life purpose with a decision.\n\nYou must decide that your purpose is already alive and well. You must decide that you\u2019ll allow yourself to experience it. You must decide to recognize it and receive it.\n\nYou must decide that living your life \u2014 as yourself \u2014 is the purpose. You must decide to love yourself through the times you forget how beautifully powerful and purposeful you are.\n\nThese decisions will free you from the despair of purposelessness.\n\nThey will empower you to alchemize your darkest moments into a rare jewel encased in 24K Gold.\n\nOn that day, I made that decision for myself. I decided that who I am is enough. I decided I was no longer available for the story of brokenness, unworthiness, or purposelessness. I decided to surrender to my gifts.\n\nAnd, in time, I returned to working on that very firstHuman Design Mapwith more devotion than I ever knew was possible.\n\nI have zero doubt that people need this work, and they need it in a way that only I can deliver.\n\nBecause everyone deserves to see, feel, and experience the purpose simmering under the surface in every thought, feeling, and action in their world.\n\nThe features of the\u200bmap\u200bhave changed a lot since then. It went from a simple PDF to a 100+ page written guide, a robust portal with plenty of follow-up support, and the MAP Method for Deconditioning course, which teaches you my three-step process for getting in tune with your inner wisdom, healing the shit that blocks you, and how to make aligned choices, even in the face of adversity. It is the \u201chow\u201d of overcoming people-pleasing and living on purpose.\u200bCheck it out here\u200b.\n\nBryan has been by my side the whole time. HisWild Heartis cheering me. And he is proud of the legacy he left behind, which was this:\n\nWe are all Love. We are all the stuff of stars. We are all under the blanket of Grace.\n\n## Affirmations for Human Design Gate 15\n\nUsing your Human Design to create affirmations is a powerful way to activate the full potential of your chart.

Gates 16 believes that practice does not make perfect \u2013 it makes mastery and the grit of mastery is infinitely more rewarding than perfection. With this attitude firmly in place, its make it\u2019s mark in the world with the mastery of it\u2019s craft.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 16 is the energy for perfectionism or hiding who you are as a result of unhealed shame. It can easily become obsessed with the \u201cright\u201d way to do things or waiting to \u201cbe ready\u201d before starting things.\n\nYou\u2019ll learn about the surprising (but most effective) way to raise your energy frequency in theHuman Design Map + Portal.\n\nIn the meantime, start noticing when you are holding yourself back in shame but don\u2019t be an asshole to yourself. Treat yourself the way you would a small child \u2013 with love, curiosity, and understanding.\n\n### My Personal Experience with Human Design Gate 16 (Gene Key 16)\n\nBothHuman Design Gate 48and Gate 16 are defined on the conscious side of my chart, creating the full channel of the wavelength.\n\nThe 16, in particular, is defined in my conscious moon in line 6.\n\nAnytime we have a gate in line 6, we will go through three distinct phases with that energy in our lives. (You canread about the Human Design Profiles and Lines here.)\n\nThe first phase, from birth to the first Saturn Return (around age 28), looks more like a 3rd line. There are lots of mistakes and failed experiments. But, unlike the 3rd line, the 6th line mostly learns the emotional resilience skills necessary to\u201cbounce back\u201d from failure in the second phase.\n\nNote:Inside the\u200bHuman Design Map Portal\u200b, you will find a course called Transits & Returns, where I explain how those are interpreted in Human Design in a bit more detail.\n\nThe second phase begins at the first Saturn Return and lasts through the Chiron Return (around age 50). During this time, the 6th line goes \u201con the roof\u201d to gain perspective, heal from the wounds of the first phase, and develop wisdom about their experiences.\n\nBy the third phase, after the Chiron Return, the sixth line steps into its role-model energy and becomes an embodiment of the wisdom it developed while on the roof.\n\nThese are the same phases anyone with a 6 in their profile will go through. If you have a 6 in your profile (3\/6, 4\/6, 6\/2, 6\/3), I will explain them in my post onprofiles and linesand even more thoroughly in the\u200bHuman Design Map\u200b.\n\nThese phases are not hard and fast rules, of course.\n\nBecause we are more than our Human Design, things like trauma, social structures,our capacity, and environment play huge roles in moving through life.\n\nThe sixth line, in particular, is very sensitive to social influence. In our current culture, we aren\u2019t encouraged to step back from life to gather perspective. We are encouraged to go, do, be, and have all the things all the time.\n\nLiving by that conditioning can prolong the healing that needs to happen for any of the 6th line energies in our chart.\n\nWhen I originally wrote this contemplation, I was 47 and still \u201con the roof\u201d with all the line 6 energy in my chart. I am not a 6th-line profile; my profile is 5\/2. But as I approach my Chiron Return, I can definitely feel the places in my chart where the 6th line is defined.\n\nIn gate 16, it has only been in the last few years that I\u2019ve gained some perspective on old patterns of perfectionism and my obsession with getting things right.\n\nGate 48plays perfectly into this. Its \u201clower\u201d expression can become paralyzed because you believe that you don\u2019t know enough.\n\nSo, when you combine the belief that you don\u2019t know enough with the belief that you need to make everything perfect, you have the perfect storm of not creating much.\n\nYou end up going in circles, often reinventing the wheel, and never \u201cfeeling ready\u201d to move forward.\n\nThis pattern became clear to me once I started my business in 2009.\n\nI would literally obsess about everything I put out into the world.\n\nOne of the first coaching programs I ever developed was calledAbundant Self Care, which included videos.\n\nI had no experience filming or editing videos, and my inner perfectionist was running the show.\n\nI genuinely believed I should be able to sit down, turn on the camera, say everything perfectly from memory, and upload the video without a single edit\u2026on the first try.\n\nAnd I was so mad and ashamed because that wasn\u2019t how it went. Ever.\n\nI remember talking to my business coach about it; she told me it was OK for it not to be perfect.\n\nGod rest her soul, she said something that changed my life:\n\n\u201cDone\u201d is better than \u201cperfect.\u201d\n\nShe told me that it was more important to start helping people by just putting something out than never producing anything.\n\nI will be forever grateful for her perspective and for how it started mydeconditioning processaround perfectionism.\n\nI wish I could say I never struggle with perfectionism anymore, but that would be a straight-up lie.\n\nI can still become obsessed over tiny details (Human Design Gate 9) and throw the baby out with the bathwater when things aren\u2019t \u201cjust right.\u201d True to gate 16 being defined in my moon, it is deeply intertwined with how I relate to my inner world.\n\nI can\u2019t even tell you how many times my inner perfectionist has told me that the\u200bHuman Design Map\u200bis shit and that I should burn it all down to the ground. Thankfully, I am surrounded by people who recognize me and can remind me as many times as it takes that my work is incredibly valuable to the world. And that perfection isn\u2019t required, or even preferred, to be of deep service to others.\n\nAs I have gotten older, gained more perspective, and learned how to self-recognize, it is much easier to catch myself in those patterns and stop them in their tracks.\n\nAnd I have even started to enjoy the process of practice and repetition (aka mastery).\n\nI\u2019ve come to embrace the idea of \u201cb minus work,\u201d letting others see me as not being perfect and putting things out into the world because they will help people rather than fluff up my ego.\n\nAt the end of the day, I can see that perfectionism is actually an epic waste of energy.\n\nPerfectionism does nothing for the people I am here to help. It gets me all up in my head, bypassing the wisdom of my body and soul. And it completely blocks my ability to master anything.\n\nAnd that is so good to know.\n\nIf you struggle with perfectionism, you\u2019ll love the process I teach inside theHuman Design Map & Portal. It will help you learn how to leverage your energy and get out of your own way.\n\n## Affirmations for Human Design Gate 16\n\nUsing your Human Design to create affirmations is a powerful way to activate the full potential of your chart.

Treat yourself the way you would a small child \u2013 with love, curiosity, and understanding.\n\n### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 17 (Gene Key 17)\n\nGate 17 is undefined in my chart, but it is one of the most significant undefined gates.\n\nFirst, gate 62, the other side of the channel of acceptance, is defined in the unconscious sun of myincarnation cross.\n\nI also have a small split definition between my throat and ajna, which can be bridged by gates 17, 23, or 11.\n\nThose two things combined make gate 17 the most electromagnetically attractive gate.\n\nGood thing I married a man with a hanging gate 17. \ud83e\udd23\n\nIt\u2019s been an interesting experience to get to know this gate.\n\nWhat I\u2019ve discovered is that I was holding a lot of \u201cnot-self\u201d themes around gate 17.\n\nI always thought that I needed to have an opinion about EVERYTHING. I wanted to be asked about my opinions, even when I didn\u2019t have one. And I often felt bitter and resentful towards others who seemed to know and express their views easily.\n\nDeconditioninggate 17 hasn\u2019t been a matter of never having an opinion. I still have plenty to go around. (Readthis,this, andthis.)\n\nThe highest potential of our undefined places is becoming wise about how, when, and why we use that energy\u2014and practicing non-attachment when we don\u2019t consistently experience that energy.\n\nWith gate 17, I discovered that I only need strong opinions sometimes \u2013 when it matters. I can have opinions without making other people\u2019s opinions wrong. And it\u2019s beneficial for me to take in all sides before forming opinions instead of just looking at one side.\n\nGate 61 in my unconscious earth also plays a role here.\n\nWhat I know is that I don\u2019t know.\n\nTruth isn\u2019t objective- it is subjective.\n\nEveryone is weaving their personal fabric of reality.\n\nEmbodying this is freedom.\n\nAnd it has given me so much energy back\u2013 especially regarding my work with Human Design andthe map.\n\nLike every other topic on the planet, the Human Design space is FULL of opinions and people ready to tell you that you are doing it wrong. And I\u2019ve had my fair share of people \u201ccoming at me\u201d about how I approach the system.\n\nThere is no way I\u2019d be able to handle the criticism if I was attached to my opinion being \u201cright.\u201d\n\nInstead, I can take full ownership that I\u2019m not trying to be right. I always tell my map clients to take what they can use and leave the rest.\n\nAs a 5\/2, I aim to make Human Design practical, simple and empowering.\n\nMy ultimate intention is to help others trust themselves and embody their personal truth \u2013 even when it doesn\u2019t match their chart.\n\nI don\u2019t believe that Human Design is the answer to all of life\u2019s problems. It is a tool that helps us focus our attention inward \u2013 and that\u2019s it.\n\nOther people have different opinions.\n\nAnd it isn\u2019t up to me to decide whether that is right or wrong. It is up to me to trust myself and the path before me.\n\nI pray that I continue to deepen into non-attachment around my opinions. And to let myself off the hook for managing the opinions of others.\n\n## Affirmations for Human Design Gate 17\n\nUsing your Human Design to create affirmations is a powerful way to activate the full potential of your chart. Here are some affirmations for Gate 17:\n\nMy opinions are trustworthy and they stand the test of time.\n\nI develop informed opinions by understanding all sides of an argument.\n\nThe answers are rarely black and white and are found in the shades of grey.\n\nInside yourHuman Design Map, you\u2019ll get a full list of empowering beliefs for your type + strategy, authority, profile, and all four gates of yourincarnation crossand show you how to go from affirmation to full-on embodiment.

Take them out into your world and let their answers reveal themselves to you.

Gate 18 understands that the only thing that needs to be \u201cfixed\u201d is the stories we tell ourselves about ourselves and about others. It easily sees the stories of brokenness that are playing out in the collective and helps others to transform those stories into wholeness.\n\nOn the \u201cnegative\u201d end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 18 is the energy for beating yourself up with negative self-talk or being hyper-focused on the flaws and mistakes of others. It drives complaining, gossiping, worrying, and needing to be right. This, of course, only perpetuates stories of brokenness.\n\nYou\u2019ll learn about the surprising (but most effective) way to raise your energy frequency in theHuman Design Map + Portal.\n\nIn the meantime, start noticing when you are feeling judgmental, critical or mean but don\u2019t be an asshole to yourself. Treat yourself the way you would a small child \u2013 with love, curiosity, and understanding.\n\n### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 18 (Gene Key 18)\n\nMy unconscious Pluto is in gate 18.6. My conscious Pluto is in gate 48 (the gate of depth) and is conjunct with my conscious sun (human design gate 57).\n\nOn the conscious side, Pluto is the place where we go through a rebirth in our lives. It takes us into the deepest shadows of our psyche and brings us out the other side with a new sense of integrity and wholeness.\n\nWhen Pluto conjunct the sun, it brings a whole new level of intensity to the (astrology) chart. It creates a drive for \u201ctruth\u201d, depth, inner transformation, and self-realization that is unrelenting.\n\nThe unconscious side of our chart represents the \u201cwound\u201d, trauma pattern, or shadow that \u201cblocks\u201d the full expression of the conscious side.\n\nThe potent combination I have brings my absolute obsession with shadow integration work and self-realization into sharp focus.\n\n(I teach shadow integration as an essential part of deconditioning once you have yourHuman Design Map.)\n\nAnd helps me to see more deeply how gate 18 in line 6 has played its part.\n\nWhen I was around 30, I was in my very first training as a coach. Debbie Ford (may she rest in power) was a guest lecturer and I became enraptured with her work.\n\nMy copy of her bookThe Dark Side of the Light Chasersis well worn with highlights, underlines, and notes.\n\nHer work is what brought my conscious awareness ofwhat the shadow is. It opened my eyes to the idea that we are already whole and that the whole word lives inside of us.\n\nThe part that I was most enamored with was her thoughts about judging others. In the book she writes:\n\n\u201cOnce we accept the fact that each of us embodies all the traits in the universe, we can stop pretending that we are not everything\u2026\n\nWe adopt prejudices from our families and friends. \u201cYou\u2019re different because you are fat and I am skinny. I am smart and you are stupid. I am timid and you are brave. I am passive and you are aggressive. I am loud and you are soft spoken.\u201d\n\nThese beliefs maintain the illusion that we are separate. They create internal as well as external barriers that keep us from embracing the totality of our being. They keep us pointing fingers at others.\n\nThe key is to understand that there is nothing we can see or perceive that we are not.\n\nIf we did not possess a certain quality, we could not recognize it in another.\n\nIf you are inspired by someone\u2019s courage, it is a reflection of the courage in you. If you think someone\u2019s selfish, you can be sure that you are capable of demonstrating the same amount of selfishness.\n\nAlthough these qualities will not be expressed all the time, we each have the ability to act out any quality we see.\u201d ~ Debbie Ford\n\nIn hindsight, I can see that this was the beginning of \u201cbeing on the roof\u201d with gate 18 in line 6. I was at the end of my first Saturn Return; it was a pivotal time when I began to unwind my inner and outer critic.\n\n(I cover how to interpret planetary seasons, such as the Saturn Return, inside theHumanDesign Mapportal. If you are already a client,you can dig in here.)\n\nI began taking full ownership of the parts in others that I judged harshly and the ongoing inner work of stepping into a sense of wholeness.\n\nAs I have done that work, it has opened me up to the depth of my gate 48. You really can\u2019t go very deep into anything if you aren\u2019t willing to confront the inner critic.\n\nAnd, I don\u2019t just mean that on the \u201cunderstanding yourself\u201d level. I also mean it very practically (says my 5th line profile!).\n\nThere is no person, no system, no lineage, no leader, no bloodline who is without \u201cfault.\u201d\u00a0 And when we allow that to hold us back, in our search for perfection, we get stopped dead in our tracks. We write them off before we even have a chance to understand on any kind of real level.\n\nRa Uru Hu, the original channeler of Human Design, immediately comes to mind. He wasn\u2019t exactly the most stand up guy and did some pretty questionable things; things that today would have had him \u201ccanceled\u201d in a heartbeat.\n\nBut, the beauty that he brought into this world with Human Design is unmistakable to me. All along the way, in the depths of my studies, I\u2019ve had to remind myself of Debbie Ford\u2019s words:\n\n\u201cThe key is to understand that there is nothing we can see or perceive that we are not. If we did not possess a certain quality, we could not recognize it in another.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve reminded myself that he was a human being, just like me, and that he was perfectly flawed, fallible and whole.\n\nAnd when I look at it that way, on purpose, it allows me to reclaim my own shadows and move deeper into this system that I love so much.\n\nWhat a beautiful dance of shadow and light.\n\n## Affirmations for Human Design Gate 18\n\nUsing your Human Design to create affirmations is a powerful way to activate the full potential of your chart. Here are some affirmations for Gate 18:\n\nHealing is always possible.\n\nAll humans, including myself, are already whole and complete.\n\nMy spidey senses are on point.\n\nInside yourHuman Design Map, you\u2019ll get a full list of empowering beliefs for your type + strategy, authority, profile, and all four gates of yourincarnation crossand show you how to go from affirmation to full-on embodiment.

Treat yourself the way you would a small child \u2013 with love, curiosity, and understanding.\n\n### My Personal Experience with Human Design Gate 19 (Gene Key 19)\n\nGate 19 isundefinedin my chart. Nonetheless, for most of my life, I was called \u201ctoo sensitive.\u201d For many years, I even identified as an \u201cempath\u201d and as an \u201cHSP.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve long shed those identities.\n\nFirst and foremost, I now understand that I am a late-discovered\u00a0neurodivergent, AuDHD.\n\nAnd despite the common misconception about Autism, many autistic people are highly sensitive and struggle with \u201cover empathy\u201d rather than not enough. That is a whole other ball of wax.\n\nBut, even just looking at it from a Human Design perspective, I see those themes, as well.\n\nI have an undefined solar plexus and that means that when I have shitty energetic boundaries, I can take on and amplify the emotional wave of thedefinedsolar plexus\u2019 around me.\n\nI used to be hyper-vigilant about the needs of others \u2013 especially their emotional needs. I often walked on eggshells because it felt SO terrible to be around people who were feeling uncomfortable emotions.\n\nI would cry at the drop of a hat. And, as I talked about in myhuman design gate 49post, I was quick to cut people out of my life.\n\nI didn\u2019t know that there were other options. That isn\u2019t to say that I tolerate bullshit now. I don\u2019t.\n\nBut, understanding my undefined root and solar plexus has been critical in transforming my relationship with the pressures of emotional sensitivity.\n\n(In theHuman Design Mapportal, you will find a guide on the nine centers to help you understand how you might be in the \u201cnot self\u201d with your centers.)\n\nMy energetic boundaries are much stronger now and I can easily discern which emotions belong to me and which ones don\u2019t. I am also getting pretty good at discerning \u201cincorrect\u201d root pressure.\n\nOne of the key tools for developing that kind of discernment is plenty ofPure Aura Time. Pure Aura Time is now one of my top priorities in life.\n\nAnd between that, and my alchemical skills ( I teach these in themapportal, too), I\u2019ve discovered that there is a massive difference betweenbeing sensitive to other people\u2019s emotional needsandtaking responsibility for them.\n\nIn our deeply codependent culture, most of us don\u2019t know the difference. But, once you see the distinction, it will be one of those things you can\u2019t unsee.\n\nWhen gate 19 is at its highest frequency, being sensitive to the emotional needs of others is actually about understanding other people\u2019s emotional needs but not necessarilydoingsomething about them. It can hold space without taking it on as something to fix.\n\nAnd, when we are really honest with ourselves about what belongs to us and what doesn\u2019t, our capacity, our boundaries, and our values, it is easy to know when to hold space and when to try to meet their needs.\n\nFor me, when my capacity is abundant and it wouldn\u2019t cause me harm to meet their needs, I 100% will. If not, I can just hold space, or in some cases, decline the invitation all together.\n\nEither way, I don\u2019t need to save anyone from themselves. I can be considerate of people\u2019s emotions while holding my boundaries. I can trust that they have what it takes to handle whatever they think and feel.\n\nAnd, probably most importantly, I can stand firmly in the knowledge that I cannot control how they take it. That is their karma, after all.\n\nIf they are one of mymapclients, I can teach them the emotional skills and show them how it\u2019s done. (If you are one of mymapclients, check out the MAP Method for Deconditioning in your map dashboard.)\n\nIf it is someone in my personal life, I can tell them the truth and I can sometimes offer guidance about where to get support. And, in the most wild cases, like with random strangers in the grocery store, I can just walk away.\n\nThere is nothing I \u201chave to\u201d do for the sake of someone else\u2019s emotional needs. I can be sensitive to their needs and let them have the responsibility.\n\nI will not light myself on fire to keep others warm.\n\nNowadays, I am much less afraid of other people\u2019s emotions and am much more discerning about who I am in relationship with.\n\nI surround myself with people whowantto understand me, who recognize me, and where mutual respect is abundant.\n\nMy peoplewantto take responsibility for their emotions because they know the alchemical magick that comes from owning your authentic feelings; they want to be their own hero.\n\nThe people I surround myself with appreciate my candor, my boundaries, and my clarity. Because it means that when I show up for them, it is because it is from an overflow of love, rather than from obligation. It is the only kind of love that sticks.\n\nToday, other people\u2019s emotional needs don\u2019t determine my next steps. Going within and discerning what is true for me does.\n\nAnd what I know for sure is that I don\u2019t have to choose between having solid boundaries and being sensitive.\n\nIt gets to be both, and that is wonderful news.\n\nIf you are ready to step into full responsibility for your needs (emotional or otherwise), grab yourmapand take the journey in the portal.\n\n## Affirmations for Human Design Gate 19\n\nUsing your Human Design to create affirmations is a powerful way to activate the full potential of your chart.

Treat yourself the way you would a small child \u2013 with love, curiosity, and understanding.\n\n### My Personal Experience with Human Design Gate 20 (Gene Key 20)\n\nGate 20 is defined in my conscious Jupiter. I talked briefly about how Gate 20 plays out in Jupiter in my contemplation ofHuman Design Gate 8.\n\nIn this contemplation, though, I wanted to reflect on my experience with the 57-20 channel (called the brainwave).\n\n(I cover all of the channels inside theHuman Design Mapportal.)\n\nGate 57 is defined in the conscious sun ofincarnation crossand the 57-20 has been super interesting to me. It is actually one of the (many) reasons that Human Design clicked with me instantly.\n\nI\u2019ve often had the experience of what I call \u201cpops of clarity.\u201d\n\nPops of clarity are sort of like sitting at a train crossing before the train arrives. You can hear the train coming, but you have no control over when it will actually show up. It shows up when it does.\n\nWith the 57-20, I can intuitively sense information \u201ccoming through\u201d and have to wait for clarity.\n\nThen, in a flash, I get a \u201cdownload\u201d that feels like it needs to be expressed\u2026.right now!\n\nThis happens a lot with mymapcustomers. They will have a question, and when I first read it, I won\u2019t know what to say. But, I will have a deep sense inside of me that something is \u201ccoming through.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve come to understand that, most often, the mechanics of the person\u2019s chart are \u201cspeaking to me\u201d and that I just need to keep listening. Sometimes, that means I ask more questions. Other times, it means I walk away in full trust that an answer is coming.\n\nAnd, not quite like clockwork \ud83d\ude09, I\u2019ll know exactly what to say and write a thousand words in a couple of minutes flat.\n\nThis is just one example of how it plays out. But let me tell you, for most of my life, it was frustrating AF.\n\nI hated the feeling of \u201cknowing\u201d something was \u201con the way\u201d and having no control over when it showed up.\n\nBut after many years ofdeconditioning, that is shifting, and I am deepening my surrender to Divine Timing.\n\nI can see that my mind goes into a tailspin and starts trying to use logic or reason to put language to the inner knowing.\n\nAnd it literally never works.\n\nWhen I try to force my intuition out, it gets muddy and never \u201clands\u201d in a very powerful way.\n\nI have learned that the best thing I can do is\u2026.be present.\n\nBe here now.\n\nEvery day, I trust that if something needs to be said, I\u2019ll know it when the time is right.\n\nI don\u2019t need to be attached to knowing how, when, where, or why. Or knowing at all.\n\nThis shift in thinking allows me to be more present; I actually have space to breathe and just live my life.\n\nProbably even more importantly, my intuition is becoming even stronger every single day. It is sharper and clearer. And when the words do come, they are more powerful than ever.\n\nWhen I surrender, my words are a healing force in the world; they heal me and the people who encounter me.\n\nIt isn\u2019t always easy, but clearly, it is part of my life\u2019s work.

For gate 21, energy management is all about balancing yin and yang, masculine and feminine, push and pull. In this way, gate 21 easily manages the mundane resources of its family, community, or company in a way that empowers everyone.\n\nOn the \u201cnegative\u201d end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 21 is the energy for controlling others to appease your ego, fearing your own power and authority, or feelings of low self-worth due to people-pleasing.\n\nYou\u2019ll learn about the surprising (but most effective) way to raise your energy frequency in theHuman Design Map + Portal.\n\nIn the meantime, start noticing when you are feeling submissive, rebellious or domineering but don\u2019t be an asshole to yourself. Treat yourself the way you would a small child \u2013 with love, curiosity, and understanding.\n\n### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 21 (Gene Key 21)\n\nGate 21 is undefined in my chart.\n\nBut my husband has it defined in the unconscious sun of hisincarnation cross. And learning that shocked me (gate 51 in my conscious earth!).\n\nI can usually sense the gates in someone\u2019s chart from a mile away. But, in my experience, \u201ccontrolling\u201d and my husband just did not go together.\n\nIn his everyday demeanor, he is incredibly respectful of every living thing he encounters (gate 19!). He has never tried to control me in any way, shape, or form. And he definitely isn\u2019t the stereotypical picture of someone who tries to control the world.\n\nSo, it truly baffled me (and made me check my ego!) that he has gate 21 as such a prominent placement.\n\nSimilar to my initial feelings about the \u201csalesman\u201d ofgate 26, I was full of negative judgment about what it really means to be a person with gate 21 defined.\n\nAs all judgments do, this pointed me to my shadows with gate 21 and the \u201ccontrolling\u201d parts of myself that I\u2019ve often rejected.\n\nWith my Aries rising + my conscious Earth, I\u2019ve often been called domineering, headstrong, and pushy. To be honest, I\u2019ve often chalked this up to being \u201cabout them\u201d and not at all about me. \ud83e\udd23\n\nBut, when I look more closely at some of the taboo shadows of gate 21 \u2013 control freak, rebel, passive-aggressive \u2013 I see myself written all over it.\n\n(I cover the golden and taboo shadows for the gates of your cross in theHuman Design Map.)\n\nI\u2019m human. When my life is out of control, I tend to try to control the world around me. I am not immune to thinking that if other people change, if circumstances were different, or everything is in its \u201cright\u201d place, all would be well with the world.\n\nAs I\u2019ve explored and integrated those shadows, I gained access to the full spectrum of energy potential in gate 21. And, because it can only work that way, my husband came into clearer view.\n\nI saw his list of every single thing in the freezer.\n\nI appreciated how he makes impossible things fit in a suitcase and pack the car when we travel.\n\nI noticed how well he manages money and his natural ability to rein in the stuff of life.\n\nAnd then I had a nice little chuckle because I remembered that his job title is Fixed Asset Manager. He literally gets paid to manage resources.\n\nWhat?!?!?!\n\nColor me shocked. How did I miss that?\n\nI missed it because I was in judgment of anyone who comes across as controlling. And I was in judgment because I was rejecting those parts of myself.\n\nWhat I teach people inside theirHuman Design Mapreally is true.\n\nEvery gate (line, center, channel, etc.) in the chart holds a spectrum of energy potential. It is our judgments, of ourselves and others, that keep us from accessing all of it.\n\nBut when we open our hearts and face the truth of our wholeness, we access our greatest potential.\n\nIt is literally all right there in the chart. Even in the gates we think are terrible.\n\n## Affirmations for Human Design Gate 21\n\nUsing your Human Design to create affirmations is a powerful way to activate the full potential of your chart.

Gate 22 understands that the full range of emotions, from the heights of ecstatic bliss to the dirtiest darkest pits of shame, are simply human. Because of this understanding, Gate 22 is able to see the whole world as an astounding place of beauty, abundance, and love.\n\nOn the \u201cnegative\u201d end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 22 is the energy for believing that you do not deserve the beauty, love, or grace in your life. It represses emotions, lives from a place of emotional reactivity and ignores responsibility for it\u2019s emotions through blame, victimization, and finding fault.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE:It\u2019s crucial to understand that \u201cpositive\u201d and \u201cnegative\u201d are not intended as moral judgments; they are tools of awareness to support you on your Human Design journey \u2014 the journey of radical self-acceptance and bold purpose.\n\nYour Human Design is never to be used as a weapon against yourself or as evidence that you are broken, unlovable, or any other bullshit that blocks your radiance.\n\nIf you see yourself on the \u201cnegative\u201d side of {gate 22}, please be kind to yourself. This is an opportunity to BE the Love and Grace you so deeply crave (we all so deeply crave!).\n\nWhen you notice yourself struggling with feeling graceless, \u201ctoo\u201d emotional or unforgiving, use it as a sign to cultivate curiosity and as a path to a more expanded self-concept.\n\nBy adopting this more compassionate way of seeing your \u201cnegative\u201d qualities and experiences, you will automatically expand into your chart\u2019s higher and higher potentials. Minus the toxic positivity or gaslighting yourself.\n\nSimply put\u2026\n\nYour ability to embody your chart\u2019s \u201chighest\u201d potential is directly proportional to your ability to unconditionally love your chart\u2019s \u201clowest\u201d potential. You cannot hate your way to Love and Grace.\n\nThis is at the heart of what you will learn in the MAP Method for Deconditioning, my signature course included with your Human Design Map (made just for you) & Portal.Get yours here.\n\nIn the meantime, start noticing when you are feeling reactive, awkward or mean but don\u2019t be an asshole to yourself. Treat yourself the way you would a small child \u2013 with love, curiosity, and understanding.\n\n### My Personal Experience with Human Design Gate 22 (Gene Key 22)\n\nOh, Gate 22, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways.\n\nI could write endless books about my experiences and love of Gate 22.\n\nThe energy of Grace has been such a significant part of my life.\n\nGate 22 is undefined in my chart, but my husband has the entire 12-22 channel.\n\n(I dive deeply into all 36 channels inside theHuman Design Map portal.)\n\nFrom a Gene Keys perspective, my husband\u2019s attraction sphere is gate 22, and I am confident that our meeting wasFierce Gracein action.\n\nThen I laid my eyes on him for the first time; I knew that our rivers were meeting for a reason.\n\nWe had some beautiful mirror work to do together.\n\nI was raised in a religious culture that perpetuated really toxic ideas about Grace. Things like Grace, Mercy, and God\u2019s Love were used as weapons to control others and ensure that \u201cthe top\u201d stayed at the top.\n\nI spent many years rebelling against any idea that even came close to the \u201cGrace\u201d of my upbringing.\n\nBut that all changed shortly after meeting my husband.\n\nMy husband isn\u2019t a \u201cspiritual\u201d kind of guy. At the beginning of our relationship, I asked him what he thinks about God, and he literally said, \u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nBut he embodies Grace on a level that I can\u2019t even describe.\n\nEven in my absolutely \u201cugliest\u201d moments, there is never a single doubt of his unconditional love.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t use my \u201cnegative\u201d states against me or as tools for manipulation.\n\nHe is deeply present with all of me \u2013 in my shadow and in my light.\n\nI can honestly say that I\u2019d never experienced that with a human being before him.\n\nHe opened me up to heal the wounds of toxic religion and energetically showed me how to receive the Fiercest Grace of all \u2013 the Grace of the Divine.\n\nShortly after we were married, I went to a Baron Baptiste yoga workshop in Dallas, Texas. I was in yoga teacher training, and he was all the rage in the vinyasa yoga scene.\n\nSo much so that I paid hundreds of dollars and flew over 1000 miles to practice yoga with himfor four hours.\n\nAnd it was an experience I will never forget.\n\nThere were hundreds of people, and we were mat to mat. Our sweat literally dripped on one another as we pushed through the incredible limits of our minds.\n\nHe guided us through 3.5 hours of vinyasa, ending with a very long savasana.\n\nKrishna Das was blaring on the speakers.\n\n\u201cMy foolish heart\n\nWhy do you weep?\n\nYou throw yourself away again\n\nNow you cry yourself to sleep.\n\nCry yourself to sleep\u2026\n\nMy foolish heart\n\nWhen will you learn?\n\nYou are the eyes of the world\n\nAnd there\u2019s nowhere else to turn.\n\nNowhere else to turn\u2026\u201d\n\nKrishna Das, My Foolish Heart, Heart as Wide as the World\n\nThere I was, my body completely vulnerable, sweat drying into a gritty mess on my skin, and deep, snotty sobs pouring out of me. Surrounded by hundreds of strangers.\n\nThere was no fear of judgment. There was no worry about what others were thinking of me. No part of me believed that I shouldn\u2019t be sobbing like that.\n\nBut more importantly, there was this deep knowing that all of me was welcome.\n\nMy body knew that I am loved without condition.\n\nNo hoops. No hierarchies. No lovable and unlovable.\n\nIt was Grace. It is all Grace.\n\nI\u2019ve had endless experiences of Grace since then.\n\nAnd, from this open place, I can even see the slivers of Grace in my early, though quite traumatic, childhood and early adulthood.\n\nBut this was the moment that made me aware that Grace is everywhere.\n\nAs I said, it is a moment I will never forget.\n\nAnd it is that moment that I want to channel in everything I do.\n\nWriting this post. Supporting my clients inside theHuman Design Map portal. Going to the grocery store.\n\nFierce Grace in action.\n\n## Affirmations for Human Design Gate 22\n\nUsing your Human Design to create affirmations is a powerful way to activate the full potential of your chart.

Treat yourself the way you would a small child \u2013 with love, curiosity, and understanding.\n\n### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 23 (Gene Key 23)\n\nGate 23 is undefined in my chart, but it is a pretty significant because it is one of the gates that will bridge my small split.\n\nWithgate 62,gate 43, andgate 56hanging, I have a small split between my ajna and throat.\n\nSo, Gate 23 is one of the gates that would bridge that split.\n\nOne of the common experiences with hanging gates, especially when they hang in a significant spot in the chart like mine, is that we can experience feelings of inadequacy in the undefined gate.\n\nAs I always say, where we are defined, we often feel like we are \u201ctoo much,\u201d and where we are undefined, we can feel like we are \u201cnot enough.\u201d And gates that bridge splits are like fuel on that fire.\n\n(I discuss the effect of hanging gates, splits, and channels more inside theHuman Design Map & Portal.)\n\nThat \u201cnot enough\u201d voice was loud and clear when I first wrote my personal contemplation of Gate 23.\n\nThat was in 2022, and I was writing the gates articles on a schedule that put me a little ahead of when the sun would transit each ofthe 64 Human Design Gates.\n\nOne of the themes that began to unfold was that my life would start to reflect the gate somehow and layers of conditioning were peeling away.\n\nAnd, true to form, that happened with Gate 23, but in a really profound way. With the gates I\u2019d written before, my life was showing me. But in this case, it was the actual process of writing.\n\nAs I stared at the screen before me, I racked my brain for something profound to say. I really wanted to blow your mind with some sort of radical insight.\n\nI started scanning for quantum leaps.What have I said to someone that triggered a quantum leap for them? What had someone said to me that completely blew my mind? What quantumn leaps was I seeing in the world around me?\n\nThen, I thought about the people with gate 23 that I\u2019ve guided. I thought about one of my coaches with Gate 23 defined. I thought about friends or people I follow online.\n\nI even started mentally making a list of \u201cprofound\u201d statements I could share.\n\nAnd, like a lightning bolt, I saw clearly what my conditioned mind was doing.\n\nMy mind was trying to compensate for my perceived inadequacy. It was telling me a story that, because this was gate 23 it must be profound and earth-shattering. I had convinced myself that if it didn\u2019t trigger a quantum leap for whoever read it, it was a worthless piece of trash.\n\nGood times. And so hilarious to me now.\u00a0 How cute of my brain.\n\nAs I saw what was happening, I was able to surrender.\n\nGate 23 doesn\u2019t \u201cmake\u201d quantum leaps happen by \u201ctrying.\u201d It happens spontaneously, through Divine Timing. And Divine Timing rarely matches our stories about timing.\n\nWhen we look at the mechanics of the chart, we can see that from the head to the ajna, we can\u2019t force the ajna to produce insight \u2013 we just have to sit with the questions and allow insight to arrive.\n\nAnd from the ajna to the throat, we can\u2019t force the \u201cright\u201d words to come out or make others receive our words. All of that is left to the mystery of synchronicity.\n\nAnd what Gate 23 shows us is that a captive audience is part of the synchronicity. Like allprojected energy, it is dependent on the receptivity of the people listening.\n\nSo, even if I say the most brilliant shit ever and you aren\u2019t receptive to it, it will not land as a quantum leap. And I can say the most mundane shit ever but it be the exact thing you needed to hear to catapult into your next iteration.\n\nIt is like a square peg, round hole scenario.\n\nForcing it won\u2019t work. Because it does not work that way.\n\nI am grateful for what Gate 23 showed me that day. I am more aware of when I am trying to conjure profound words, instead of just letting them flow. I don\u2019t need to carry the weight of that anymore.\n\nBy design, I will just keep attuning to my Gate 43 and let the mystery of Grace take care of the rest.\n\nPretty profound, no?\n\n## Affirmations for Human Design Gate 23\n\nUsing your Human Design to create affirmations is a powerful way to activate the full potential of your chart. Here are some affirmations for Gate 23:\n\nI make things simple and clear.\n\nI get right to the point and don\u2019t mince words.\n\nMy words are magic.\n\nInside yourHuman Design Map, you\u2019ll get a full list of empowering beliefs for your type + strategy, authority, profile, and all four gates of yourincarnation crossand show you how to go from affirmation to full-on embodiment.

I\u2019ve struggled with all sorts of addiction in my life \u2014drugs, alcohol, sex with strangers, food\u2014the thing about silence wasn\u2019t really clear, though.\n\nIt took years of lived experience\u2014sobriety, self-inquiry, and prioritizingpure aura time\u2014before I truly understood that silence isn\u2019t just the absence of noise.\n\nWhen the world around us is quiet, our thoughts get LOUD. And it can be uncomfortable AF.\n\nIn that discomfort, the voice of rationalization (addiction) rises up, as if its a savior on a white horse.\n\nThat became crystal clear to me one day while driving in silence (on of my favorite pure aura time practices). No music, no podcasts, no audiobooks.\n\nJust me and my mind.\n\nSuddenly, with pristine clarity, I heard the voice of addiction.\n\nI was rationalizing making a harmful choice. Thoughts that, maybe even the day before, would have driven me straight into old patterns. They weren\u2019t dramatic thoughts; they actually sounded quite reasonable:\n\n- A little won\u2019t hurt.\n\n- Just make it easy on yourself.\n\n- This time will be different; I can handle it.\n\nBut reason is flawed and true mysticism requires surrendering it.\n\nAnd in that moment, I realized that my addictive voice sounded nothing like I\u2019d assumed. It didn\u2019t feel chaotic, out of control, or irrational. Instead, it was a calm, convincing voice that seemed so true.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t the truth; it was justifying one of the things that disconnects me from my inner truth. It was the snake in the Garden of Eden.\n\nHad I been listening to a podcast, or book, or even my belovedTrevor Hall, I might not have even heard it. I would have been well on my way to the land of disconnection.\n\nIn the silence, though, Iheardthe loop.\n\nAnd because I heard it, I had power over it. I did not have to believe it (aka act on it as if it was the Truth).\n\nInstead, I just kept driving to my intended destination.\n\n(Inside the\u200bHuman Design Map\u200b, I guide you through the patterns in your chart that show up just like this\u2014because when you can witness the story while it\u2019s happening, you finally get to choose something different.)\n\nThat day, Gate 24 clicked for me in a whole new way. And my path with addiction changed.\n\nGate 24 was no longer just the \u201cgate of the addict.\u201d It was the voice of the mind trying to escape discomfort. It was the justifier. The sweet-talker. The one that makes running away from my inner world look like wisdom.\n\nAnd more than anything, it was a reflection of how hard it can be tojust bewith ourselves when everything is quiet. To look inside and meet our maker. To receive the blessings of inner truth.\n\nWhen we believe every thought, silence can feel like torture. When we\u2019ve built our lives around productivity, pleasure, or people-pleasing, silence can feel like failure. When we don\u2019t have the skills to be with ourselves, it can feel like the only thing left to do is drown our sorrows.\n\nSome of us escape with substances. Others through work, scrolling, sex, overthinking, or staying busy all the time. But no matter the vice, the problem is the same: trying to avoid the discomfort that arises when we slow down enough to witness ourselves honestly.\n\nWe\u2019re not taught how to do that. There\u2019s no \u201cThought Loops 101\u201d in school. No one teaches us how to sit in the gap between a thought and a choice.\n\nBut Gate 24 shows us that space. And that\u2019s where our power returns.\n\n(If you\u2019re learning how to discern the difference between your truth and your mental conditioning, your chart will show you exactly where to look. That\u2019s what I teach in the\u200bHuman Design Map & Portal\u200b.)\n\nObviously, I can\u2019t say with certainty that I\u2019ll never revisit old behaviors. The loop still runs sometimes. The temptation to escape still shows up.\n\nBut I\u2019m onto myself now.\n\nYou can\u2019t un-hear these thoughts once you recognize them for what they are. Addiction. Avoidance. Rationalization.\n\nBut when you make the space to be with yourself, in the silence, you can\u2019t unsee your power, either.\n\nAnd it is that remembering that is the magick.\n\nThat\u2019s why I created the\u200bHuman Design Map\u200b\u2014not as a rulebook or magic pill, but as a mirror. A compassionate tool for helping you recognize the patterns, the loops, and the moments where you finally have the choice to return to yourself.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been caught in the loop between knowing your truth but not living it, I can help you navigate the way.\u200b\ud83d\udc49 Click here to get your Human Design Map & Portal\u200b.\n\n## Affirmations for Human Design Gate 24\n\nUsing your Human Design to create affirmations is a powerful way to activate the full potential of your chart.

Gate 25 believes that God is unconditional love and that every person on the planet is worthy of it. It knows that love conquers all and that the true path to unconditional love is acceptance of what is.\n\nOn the \u201cnegative\u201d end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 25 is the energy for judging yourself and others. Gate 25 may experience a lot ofself-rejection, self-hatred, and self-loathing and mayshut down when trauma leaves an impression of being unworthy of love.\n\nYou\u2019ll learn about the surprising (but most effective) way to raise your energy frequency in theHuman Design Map + Portal.\n\nIn the meantime, start noticing when you are feeling shut down, ignorant, or closed off but don\u2019t be an asshole to yourself.

Butgate 51, which is the other side of the channel of initiation with gate 25, is defined in my conscious earth.\n\nOur conscious earth is the energy that keeps us grounded and gives us the foundation necessary to surrender to our soul\u2019s purpose (the conscious sun).\n\nMy conscious sun is in gate 57, meaning my soul\u2019s purpose is to prioritize intuitive clarity above all else.\n\nAnd the foundation I need in place to do that is the attitude of awakening that comes from the highest frequency of gate 51.\n\n(I deep dive into your conscious sun + earth + all 36 channels + more in theHuman Design Map.)\n\nGate 51 is the gate of shock. And that shock can make us bitter, resentful, and unconscious in our lives.\n\nOn the other hand, shock can facilitate opening up to higher planes of consciousness and spiritual awareness.\n\nBut it isn\u2019t the shock itself that does that.\n\nWhat cracks our heart wide open is the revelation that Unconditional Love is the very fabric of the Universe.\n\nSo many of us have been conditioned to believe that Love is conditional. We have been taught that we have to jump through hoops to be lovable, worthy, and whole.\n\nIn that conditioning, we forget that we are the Divine Incarnate. We let it slip from our awareness that we are Love in action. We turn our back on the Grace, Compassion, Forgiveness, and Acceptance that is available to us in every moment.\n\nEven a tiny glimpse of those things can be shocking when we are trapped in the illusion of being separated from the Divine.\n\nBut in those glimpses, we remember.\n\nWe call back the seeds of Truth and we reorient ourselves to the never ending practice of Unconditional Love. For ourselves, for others, for the things that happen, for the state of the world.\n\nAnd it isn\u2019t exactly easy. If it were easy, everyone would do it, right?\n\nBut what I know for sure is that it\u2019s worth it. The ripple effect is worth it. The work of not turning against ourselves, and others, is worth it.\n\nIf you want a guide as you practice Unconditional Love, invite me in theHuman Design Map.\n\n## Affirmations for Human Design Gate 25\n\nUsing your Human Design to create affirmations is a powerful way to activate the full potential of your chart. Here are some affirmations for Gate 25:\n\nI love myself and others without conditions.\n\nMy heart is open and I thrive.\n\nI move forward by loving and accepting what is.\n\nInside yourHuman Design Map, you\u2019ll get a full list of empowering beliefs for your type + strategy, authority, profile, and all four gates of yourincarnation crossand show you how to go from affirmation to full-on embodiment.

What would true unconditional love do?\n\nWhat conditions do you place of loving yourself? What if you dropped those conditions and loved for loves sake?\n\nWhat conditions do you place on loving others?

I also noticed that a lot of the traditional Human Design information seemed only to reiterate that \u201cnegative\u201d image.\n\nThe sleazy car salesperson will do and sayanythingto get the sale. They follow you around the lot and try to convince you that a Pinto is a Rolls Royce.\n\nThat was definitely the original image that was building in my mind and I noticed incredible amounts of resistance building up inside of me. Which, in so many cases, is a signal that there is ashadowready to be transformed into valuable purpose.\n\nSo, in noticing the resistance, I reflected on what it has been like learning sales and marketing as a business owner and creator of theHuman Design Map.\n\nThough I have only been selling themapsince 2020, I have been in business since 2009. And true to my Midheaven being inhuman design gate 54, I quickly realized that sales and marketing would be part of my life almost every single day.\n\nBefore I was in business, I deeply believed that \u201cbeing spiritual\u201d and making money were opposed to one another. I was raised in a toxic religion and under the weight of patriarchal systems of oppression.\n\nIn those first years in business, something became crystal clear, though.\n\nWithout sales and marketing, I don\u2019t make money. And if I don\u2019t make money, I can\u2019t pay my mortgage, buy groceries, or stock my bookshelves. \ud83d\ude42\n\nAs I began to awaken to material success being a valid spiritual path (54), I realized that I\u2019d need to overcome my negative connotations with sales and develop it as a skill that I am confident in.\n\nI\u2019ve come a long way with it, for sure, and by no means did I think I was done with my growth in this area. It seems I am always learning from the mistakes of the past (44) and figuring out what really works for me and myprojector aura.\n\nBut, even with well over a decade of that journey under my belt, I wasn\u2019t expecting that contemplating gate 26 would be so healing for me.\n\nAnd, whether sales are a regular part of your life or not, I think that what I learned could be an important lesson for you, too.\n\nBy now, it is probably clear AF that my relationship with the Divine is important to me.Human Design Gate 61in my unconscious earth means that I am a mystic. I am spiritually grounded and connected by having direct experience of the Divine and finding the golden thread among all paths to \u201cGod.\u201d\n\nAnd I have grown a lot from my religious upbringing.\n\nI never really resonated with the churches I was raised in, and I abandoned those beliefs in my late teens.\n\nBy my early twenties, I had made my way into a life of drugs, alcohol, and sex with strangers.\n\nThat whole decade is basically a blur until my brother died shortly after my 28th birthday (aka first Saturn Return). It was the first of many spiritual awakenings that led me to where I am today (which honestly cannot easily be defined with words).\n\n(If you are one of mymapclients, be sure to check out the quick and dirty guide on Planetary Seasons in themapportal.)\n\nA couple years after I came out of my Saturn Return, I was introduced toRichard Rohrand one of his most popular books,Falling Upward.\n\nThe book\u2019s premise is that in the first spiritual phase of our lives, we rely on other people to tell us who God is and tell us what to do to get into God\u2019s Good Graces.\n\nAnd, in the second spiritual phase of our lives, we begin to open up to our own understanding of God. It becomes a personal relationship instead of a dictated one.\n\nIn the book, he offers his personal insights about the possibilities of what that could be.\n\nBut, more importantly than that, he talks about the difference betweencollapsing our definition of Godorexpanding it.\n\nHe posits that when we face challenges in our lives, we tend to make our definition of God smaller. And that the very impulse to \u201ccollapse\u201d God is an invitation to expand your definition of God.\n\nIn other words, if your definition of God isn\u2019t big enough to hold whatever you are going through, it means you need to make your definition of God bigger.\n\nThis completely blew my mind. I can vividly remember storming out of my parent\u2019s house at the age of 18, telling them that I didn\u2019t believe in God.\n\nI had certainly made my definition of God smaller. I could not reconcile my lived experience with that old definition of God.\n\nSo, when I read that book, I made a promise to myself that I was willing to reckon with my definition of God and the beliefs about the world that I hold dear. And that if my beliefs couldn\u2019t reconcile out, I\u2019d make God even bigger.\n\nAnd this brings me back to Human Design Gate 26.\n\nI have long held the belief that everyshadowis simply unconscious energy \u201cleaking out sideways.\u201dAll energy lives on a spectrumand, therefore, there is always a conscious (aka light) side.\n\nWhen we harness our energy with conscious intent, we make magick. It is just a matter of looking at the shadows through a fresh, non-dualistic, non-judgmental lens.\n\nBut gate 26. UGH. I was hearing all the sales coaches in my head telling me that \u201csales are service.\u201d I was trying to see the gifts, the value, the innate lovability. But the sleazy car salesman just kept appearing in my mind.\n\nI felt myselfcollapsing. Like, this tiny little gate in thewill centerwould be the death of my faith inshadow work. LOL.\n\nAnd then, it hit me.\n\nGo bigger.\n\nGo bigger than the judgment. Go bigger than the car lot. Go bigger than uncomfortable sales conversations.\n\nGo bigger.\n\nI looked at it in a new light and asked myself what it would look like if I made the definition of the 26 bigger than a mere sleazy car salesman? What would it look like to believe that the natural salesperson inside every human soul is full of light? What if I loved the 26 as much as I love the22? Or the57? Or the61?\n\nWhat if I opened my mind to the possibility of EVERY quality having potential for beauty, awe, and wonder? And what if I let myself love all of the parts that make up that potential?\n\nThe result of that question was a deeper understanding of thespectrumof the 26.\n\nYes, sales are service when they serve everyone involved. And yes, integrity is the most essential value of the 26. And yes, the 26 does help us move into more expanded possibilities in our lives by selling us the things that can take us there.\n\nBut at the heart of the 26 is TRUST in the abundance of the Universe.\n\nIn that knowing, I could see myself in the sleazy car salesman. I could see myself trying to control and manipulate others. I could see myself convincing myself that my intentions are pure even when they aren\u2019t.\n\nAnd with that, my heart exploded with compassion. For me. For the sleazy car salesman. And for everyone who has been in theshadowsof the 26 because they weren\u2019t trusting in the abundance of life.\n\nThis applies to so many areas of our lives. Not just sales, marketing, and business.\n\nBut, relationships, food, money, love, worthiness. Everything.\n\nWhat would it look like to trust in the abundance of life?\n\nThe answer is in the confidence of the fully conscious 26.\n\nAnd, if you want to learn how to transform your own perspective of these parts of yourself, get yourmapand go on the journey inside themapportal. It is exactly what happens there.\n\n## Affirmations for Human Design Gate 26\n\nUsing your Human Design to create affirmations is a powerful way to activate the full potential of your chart.

Treat yourself the way you would a small child \u2013 with love, curiosity, and understanding.\n\n### My Personal Experience with Human Design Gate 27 (Gene Key 27)\n\nGate 27 is defined in my conscious South Node.\n\nThe gates in our nodes tell the two-part story of how our soul grows into the realization of our deeper purpose\u2014theincarnation cross.\n\nAt first, our purpose can feel distant\u2014quiet, hidden, or even non-existent. But as we grow through the nodal gates\u2014layer by layer\u2014we begin to see that our purpose is already alive and well. It was simply waiting for us to witness it and receive its bounty.\n\nThe gate in the South Node marks the first major growth arc toward embodied purpose. It\u2019s the origin story\u2014the area of development that builds the foundation for the second phase, which begins at the Uranus Opposition.\n\nThat\u2019s when we begin shifting into the second major growth arc, led by the North Node. As we grow through that gate, we begin to experience the undying presence of our purpose\u2014how everything that came before was preparing us to truly receive the beauty and wisdom of our soul\u2019s purpose.(Inside theHuman Design Map & Portal, you\u2019ll find a guide on transits and planetary seasons like the Uranus Opposition\u2014plus tools and support to help you navigate the path.)\n\nMy incarnation cross is the Left Angle Cross of the Clarion 2\u2014a path of intuitive clarity (57), awakening (51), giving voice to truths that cut through illusion (62),\u00a0and mysticism (61).\n\nBut I didn\u2019t always see that unfolding. I saw myself as too much\u2014too woo-woo, too deep, too intense. I thought I needed to tone it all down just to fit in. And I felt purposeless so much of the time.\n\nAs I got older and started leaning into the arc of my Gate 27 South Node, I began to prioritize my own care. I started choosing my well-being over people-pleasing\u2014and everything began to shift.\n\nBefore that, my life was spent caught in the karmic tension between caring for others and constantly feeling drained. I put my needs at the very end of the line.\n\nI drowned them in food, alcohol, drugs, and sex with strangers. I knew how to \u201cshow up\u201d for other people, but I abandoned myself constantly. And when I got sober and quit binge eating, I had to face how little I actually knew about what I needed.\n\nTaking away the addictions left gaping holes I didn\u2019t know how to fill. It was like a crash course in true and deep self-care.\n\nIn the beginning of that journey, I didn\u2019t have astrology orHuman Designto help me navigate the path. I relied on surface-level things like Pinterest quotes and clich\u00e9 Cosmo listicles. And honestly? Some of those things did help.\n\nBut the real change began when I was able to take those surface-level tips and alchemize them into real, energetic insight.\n\nThat\u2019s where astrology, energy healing, andHuman Designcame in. They helped me see my needs more clearly\u2014beyond coping mechanisms and towardenergetic alignment.\n\nFor example, with my5\/2 profile, I realized how important it is for my body to get its alone time. I thrive when my days are open and full of space\u2014space to be in natural rhythm, to follow what feels alive, to rest when I need to. And my mind needs to sort through the mess of conventional wisdom and come up with heretical solutions.\n\n(YourHuman Design profileholds so many clues about what you need and how you deliver your gifts. If you\u2019re still figuring yours out, I break it down in depth in theHuman Design Map & Portal.)\n\nThat\u2019s just one of many examples. But at the end of the day, when I treat those things as essential care instead of afterthoughts, I feel more connected to myself, my gifts, and my purpose.\n\nInstead of waking up every day and dreading it, I love serving my clients in theMap Portal. My personal relationships feel mutual and grounded. I no longer feel like I have to set myself on fire to keep everyone else warm.\n\nPutting those foundational pieces in place has given me the capacity to lean into the next arc\u2014Gate 28, my North Node. When I\u2019m well-nourished and cared for, I\u2019m more willing to take risks, explore the dark places, and shape the meaning of my life with purpose.\n\nAnd in turn, that opens up even more trust in my intuition, radical faith in life, potent words, and spiritual exploration.\n\nMore importantly, I can see that purpose unfolding. I don\u2019t need to \u201cfind my purpose\u201d or look for it in elusive places. It is alive and well. I can feel it in my bones. And I know it in every cell of my being.\n\nOf course, I\u2019m still learning. I\u2019m still softening. I\u2019m still showing up when it gets hard.\n\nAnd even though it\u2019s messy sometimes, I know\u2014without a shadow of a doubt\u2014that none of that beauty can unfold if I\u2019m abandoning myself.\n\nOnward and upward.\n\nIf you\u2019re stuck in patterns of over-giving or struggling to meet your own needs, your chart holds themapfor coming back home to yourself. Whether or not you have Gate 27 defined, honoring the full picture of your energy is the key to creating beauty and purpose in a way you experience in your bones.\n\nI\u2019d love to show you the ropes.\ud83d\udc49 Click here to get your Human Design Map & Portal.\n\n## Affirmations for Human Design Gate 27\n\nUsing your Human Design to create affirmations is a powerful way to activate the full potential of your chart.

Gate 28 embracesthe wisdom of fearand allows fear to walk alongside as it navigates life. In this relationship with fear, gate 28 finds deep joy in overcoming obstacles and can find meaning in purpose in all of life.\n\nOn the \u201cnegative\u201d end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 28 is the fear of dying before \u201cfinding\u201d or fulfilling apurpose in life. It avoids stillness, silence, and slowing down and attempts to dispel fear with risky behavior. It can easily find itself lost in depression, hopelessness, purposelessness, and meaninglessness.\n\nYou\u2019ll learn about the surprising (but most effective) way to raise your energy frequency in theHuman Design Map + Portal.\n\nIn the meantime, start noticing when you are feeling dark, rebellious or like a lunatic but don\u2019t be an asshole to yourself. Treat yourself the way you would a small child \u2013 with love, curiosity, and understanding.\n\n### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 28 (Gene Key 28)\n\nGate 28 is defined in my chart 4 times:\n\n- Conscious North Node in 28.2\n\n- Conscious Mars 28.1\n\n- Conscious Uranus 28.5\n\n- Unconscious Uranus 28.2.\n\nIn astrology, anytime we have three or more planets in the same sign, it is known as a stellium, which is a fancy word for super important. The energy of the stellium will be like a golden thread that runs through your whole life, creating ripple effects in the rest of your chart.\n\nAnd, well, with Gate 28 being all about our relationship to death, this one belongs in the \u201cyou can\u2019t make this shit up\u201d category.\n\nDeath met me early in life.\n\nIt was a Wednesday and my second grade teacher pulled me to the side to tell me that my great grandfather had died.\n\nA couple of years later, a grandmother. A popular girl died in a tragic accident during high school. Two close friends died by suicide shortly after.\n\nDuring my first Saturn return, one of my brothers died in a car accident at age 25, followed quickly by an aunt and my grandfather.\n\nThen, in 2020, my other brother died of a drug overdose at 36, and my grandmother, less than two months later.\n\nThe reminder that life is fragile, dotting my life like sprinkles on a cupcake. I learned fast and early that life can change in an instant and in ways you never imagined possible.\n\nWe are living AND we are dying. At the same time.\n\nAnd despite our rugged attempts at trying, we can\u2019t actually run from the reality of nature. The dance between life and death is the way that it is.\n\nFor the first part of my life, death was difficult for me to process. Like so many in the West, I was ill equipped and poorly supported in grief and loss.\n\nThe world often seemed cruel \u2013 like a sick karmic joke. And I found escape in drugs, binge drinking, and sex with strangers. I fell into dark holes of believing that life had no meaning and that I had no purpose except to suffer.\n\nMy relationship with death started to shift after my first brother died, though.\n\nIn all honesty, I can\u2019t say that I processed his death in a healthy way. But, it did mark a pivotal moment of awakening for me.\n\nAs the weeks turned into months, Saturn\u2019s message was clear:\n\nI could not continue the path I was on. I had to change. There were no if\u2019s, and\u2019s, or but\u2019s about it.\n\nThe first shift in my awareness was that we have a choice in how we handle grief. We can use it as fuel for expanding our consciousness or we can use it to collapse in the face of life.\n\nWithin a few years, I was well on my path with shadow integration work. I had heard about it in my very first training as a coach and was hooked instantly.\n\nHuman Design, or even astrology, were not on my radar yet. But, I was consciously walking away from the toxic religious conditioning of my childhood. And I was starting to be recognized for my natural projector gifts as a guide and truth teller.\n\nTo my surprise, shadow work seemed like a language that my body already knew how to speak. As I worked with clients, going into the depths of someone\u2019s shame and fear was like a normal day at the office.\n\nI was not afraid of it. I held space for the kind of darkness that most people don\u2019t even know exist. And, through the mystery of Grace, people seemed to be \u201chealed\u201d in my presence.\n\nAnd, by healed, I mean they were able to see themselves clearly \u2013 as a fractal of the Divine \u2013 in the Great Mirror of life. My words, shaking them awake and forcing them to surrender under the weight of their Divinity.\n\nAnd while it looks different and my role isn\u2019t the same, now, I still hold space for that kind of healing today inside theHuman Design Mapportal.\n\nIt\u2019s one of the reasons I love Human Design so much \u2013 it is like a fast track to the shadows that are in desperate need of our attention, acceptance, and unshakeable love.\n\nAnd when we meet ourselves there, eyes wide open, miracles happen.\n\nOur consciousness expands and we become capable of holding a broader spectrum of frequencies in our lives. The highs become higher and the lows become lower, and none of it is better or worse. We embrace ourwholeness.\n\n(You\u2019ll learn \u201chow\u201d inside theHuman Design Mapportal.)\n\nIt has only been recently that I\u2019ve made the connection between all of thatanddeath.\n\nRichard Rudd, of theGene Keys, talks about the connection between purpose, shadow, and death all the time.\u00a0 And it was his work, on Gate 28 (Gene Key 28), that opened me up to the connection to begin with.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t until my second brother died, in 2020, that it all started to click.\n\nAs weird as it sounds, his death was a profoundly healing experience around purpose and death for me. I write about it in my post onGate 15, which was his conscious sun.\n\nOne of the things that became clear was that it is only the ego that dies.\n\nHis soul continues to live and breathe. He is with me. I can hear him laugh.\n\nHis wild hearted essence still permeates my life. His purpose is alive and well. Minus the attachment.\n\nAnd when we are transforming our shadows into light, when we are facing the deepest darkest parts of ourselves, we are letting go of attachments.\n\n(You\u2019ll learn how all that works \u2013 in the context of your Human Design \u2013 inside theHuman Design Mapportal.)\n\nOur ego \u2013 the parts of ourselves that are attached to being seen as good, worthy, enough \u2013 dies. The strings of attachment turning to ash in the fires of Fierce Grace.\n\nWe understand, however briefly, that we are whole. We let go of the shame. We become humbled by the power of unconditional love.\n\nAnd then, we do it again and again. Meeting ourselves there.\n\nDying. Dying. Dying again.\n\nI have often joked that I\u2019ve lived many lifetimes in this one life. Or that past me would be dead or in jail by now.\n\nThe transformations I\u2019ve gone through are nothing short of wild AF. Like, how in the world did I go from being a strung out addict to being a guide to thousands inside theHuman Design Mapportal?\n\nI understand now that it is because of all of the attachments I\u2019ve let go of.\n\nIn the words of Carl Jung, I would rather be whole than good. Trying to be good was killing me. And letting go seemed like the only choice to make.\n\nThat isn\u2019t to say that it is easy or that I always navigate it with Grace. It gets messy AF and I have moments I\u2019m not proud of.\n\nBut, I do take comfort in the thought that only the ego dies. And that I\u2019ve done that a million times already.\n\n## Affirmations for Human Design Gate 28\n\nUsing your Human Design to create affirmations is a powerful way to activate the full potential of your chart.

To Gate 29, commitment, faith, and devotion are magical medicine when they come from the heart and from what truly lights you up. But poison when they come from obligation, fear, or as an attempt to prove your worthiness. In this knowing, it has the energy to be devoted from a place of love and being lit up.\n\nOn the \u201cnegative\u201d end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 29 is the energy for feeling burned out or overcommitted. If it gets trapped in cycles of trying to prove its worthiness and stays devoted to things that don\u2019t really matter, it can quickly become depleted and frustrated.\n\nYou\u2019ll learn about the surprising (but most effective) way to raise your energy frequency in theHuman Design Map + Portal.\n\nIn the meantime, start noticing when you are feeling fickle, fanatical or submissive but don\u2019t be an asshole to yourself. Treat yourself the way you would a small child \u2013 with love, curiosity, and understanding.\n\n### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 29 (Gene Key 29)\n\nOne of the things I am often talking to Generators and Manifesting Generators, both insidethe mapportal and otherwise, is that when the sacral says YES to something, it is an indicator of long term commitment, not just the present moment.\n\nSome of them have been disillusioned by the promises of \u201cfollowing their strategy and authority.\u201d When they say YES to something they love or that \u201clights them up\u201d, they are surprised when challenges crop up, some parts feel really hard, or, heaven forbid, when it simply doesn\u2019t work out.\n\nMaybe they felt completely lit up by a job opportunity and they didn\u2019t get hired. Or they responded to a need in the marketplace with their services and no one purchased. Or they moved into their dream home and it ended up being a nightmare.\n\nThey often think they must not have been really listening to their authority and begin questioning themselves. Or, they become upset with the system because of its broken promises.\n\nThe problem here is two fold.\n\nFor one, the marketing within the Human Design space often makes it look like \u201cfollowing your strategy and authority\u201d will lead you to a life of pure bliss and mattresses full of money.\n\nAnd it just doesn\u2019t work that way.\n\nHuman Design does not give us a free pass from the real, lived Human experience. To be a human means a life that is a mix of a broad spectrum of emotions, experiences, and circumstances. Some parts will be amazing AF and other parts will just plain suck.\n\nAnd things aren\u2019t going right or wrong, either way. Life just is what it is.\n\nHuman Design is a beautiful doorway into self-discovery. And in some cases, will even feel like a huge permission slip tofinallybe authentic.\n\nBut it won\u2019t solve the challenges of life.\n\nWhich leads me to the second part of the problem.\n\nA sacral YES isn\u2019t a promise of bliss. That isn\u2019t what the sacral does \u2013 at all.\n\nThe sacral sustains life.\n\nWithin the sacral, we see the energy for making babies, caring for others, and seeing projects through. None of which will be a cake walk 24\/7.\n\nWhen the sacral says yes, it is saying:\n\nI have the energy to sustain raising a child, including changing shitty diapers.\n\nThis project is going to be epic and I have what it takes to get it done, no matter what challenges crop up along the way.\n\nI\u2019m going to grow this garden; I will water it, feed it, deal with the pests, and harvest the fruits of my labor.\n\nThat is what the sacralloves to do. Seeing it through is what lights up a sacral like the most stunning sunrise you\u2019ve ever seen. Finding your way through the balance of the baby smiles and shitty diapers is the recipe for satisfaction.\n\nWhich brings me back to gate 29.\n\nWhen I first wrote the contemplation for the 29, I\u2019d had a bit of an epiphany that thedevotionof the 29 was different thancommitment.\n\nI realize now, though, that the words I used didn\u2019t do a great job of saying what I was seeing. What I was attempting to do was give voice to the trying to the difference between the sacral and the will, particularly in the lower frequencies.\n\nBoth my sacral and will center are undefined. And teasing apart the differences is something that has been a big part of my wisdom journey.\n\nI see it more clearly now.\n\nIn the highest frequency, the 29 isdevoted(aka committed) to the callings of the higher heart (what I call the G center). It listens for the voice of the magnetic monopole (aka soul) and follows it relentlessly by surrendering its outdated egoic attachments.\n\nIn the highest frequency, the will center summons willpower to break through the limits of the ego. It doesn\u2019t use willpower to force \u201cincorrect\u201d shit to happen. It serves (40), competes (51), sells (26), and takes charge (21) to expand its consciousness of what it means to be a human with a functioning ego.\n\nBut in the lower frequencies, the sacral will stick with it because they think they should, not because they love it and find it truly satisfying. And the will uses willpower to stay stuck inside an egoic box.\n\nAnd what I often see is Gens and Mani Gens using low frequency willpower to fuel the commitments that just don\u2019t fit anymore. The warm soft glow of the lit up sacral has long burned out. So, they start forcing themselves just to stay in the outdated identity.\n\nLike someone who stays in a shitty marriage because they don\u2019t know who they are without their spouse. They are so attached to the identity of being married that they start using willpower to show up in the marriage.\n\nThis, of course, often happens with non-sacral types as well. And the deconditioning we do with Human Design really helps us to explore all the ways we are forcing energy rather than flowing with it.\n\nAnd what the 29 shows up, so beautifully, is that sticking with something is actually quite satisfying, when it is the higher heart calling the shots, rather than society, culture, and corrupt tribal attachments.\n\nWhen we are coming from our own inner wisdom \u2013 the higher heart \u2013 the energy will be there. And surrendering to that truth is the magic.\n\nIf you want some guidance on your path of surrender, grab yourmapand meet me in the portal.\n\n## Affirmations for Human Design Gate 29\n\nUsing your Human Design to create affirmations is a powerful way to activate the full potential of your chart.

Gate 30 has an innate knowing that a full spectrum of intense feelings are a natural part of the human experience.

Without surrendering to the full spectrum of emotion, Gate 30 can lose it\u2019s faith in life and the connection to desire.\n\nYou\u2019ll learn about the surprising (but most effective) way to raise your energy frequency in theHuman Design Map + Portal.\n\nIn the meantime, start noticing when you are feeling insatiable, depraved or solicitous but don\u2019t be an asshole to yourself. Treat yourself the way you would a small child \u2013 with love, curiosity, and understanding.\n\n### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 30 (Gene Key 30)\n\nAt this point, I have surrendered to my love affair with theHuman Design gates(andthe lines:D).\n\nThe gates capture the essence of the archetypal journey of being human and give us such clear and precise language to express our experiences.\n\nBy understanding thefull spectrumof potential in the gates, they can alchemize judgment into compassion and shame into wholeness. They show us that there isn\u2019t just one side of the story and that how we work with any given energy determines our overall vibration.\n\nWhen we work skillfully with the energy of any gate in the chart, it vibrates at a higher frequency than when we are completely unconscious of our expression of it.\n\n(I\u2019ll do a deep dive on the full spectrum of potential for all the gates in yourincarnation crossin yourHuman Design Map.)\n\nGate 30 is the one that demonstrated this in a way that I will never forget.\n\nGate 30 and mysolar plexusareundefined, so part of my higher purpose is gathering wisdom about emotional energy.\n\nAnd gather wisdom, I have. \ud83d\ude02\n\nLike many others in my generation (and the generations before me), I was taught to be afraid and ashamed of my emotions. I was conditioned to believe that my emotions were a problem (even the so-called positive ones) and that I was terrible and wrong for expressing them.\n\nPlus, I was raised in an environment where certain emotions meant literal danger, and I became hypervigilant in being an emotional caretaker to keep myself safe.\n\nTo soothe my emotions, I began binge eating at the age of 8, and that turned to exercise bulimia in my early teens. That eventually turned into drugs and alcohol in my early adult years.\n\nDuring my first Saturn Return, one of my brothers died in a car accident. As profound loss and significant astrological milestones tend to do, this was a major turning point in my life.\n\nWithin a few years, I had completely turned my life around. I got into therapy and started to learn about my emotions.\n\nAs time progressed, I started to see that all of the emotions moving through me weren\u2019t my own. I was often taking on the emotions of others and made myself responsible for resolving them. Food, exercise, drugs, and alcohol were my ways of dealing with the truth \u2013 that shit was never mine to hold.\n\nBecause that is the thing about other people\u2019s emotions \u2013 no matter how open, undefined, or wise we are \u2013 we can\u2019t do other people\u2019s emotional work for them.\n\nWith that awareness, I started to embody clearer boundaries. I prioritizedspending lots of time in my own pure auraand developed discernment about which emotions belonged to me and which ones didn\u2019tdidn\u2019t.\n\nI did a metric fuck ton of shadow integration work around the way I found so-called worthiness in being other people\u2019s emotional dumping ground and how hard it often felt to let go of shit that wasn\u2019t mine.\n\nThe more clarity I got and integrated I became, something magickal happened.\n\nI started to notice that when emotions were actually mine to deal with and when I revered them enough to be present with them, they weren\u2019t so scary. I realized that they hold potent wisdom and that allowing them is how you access that wisdom.\n\n(I\u2019ll teach you how inside theHuman Design Mapportal (no matter your solar plexus definition.)\n\nAnd true to the highest frequency of gate 30, I found that I could even experience pleasure in so-called negative emotions.\n\nThe real turning point was when I had an orgasm while processing shame.\n\nYes, you read that correctly. Feeling shame gave me an orgasm.\n\nI told you I had an experience I will never forget. \ud83d\ude09\n\nIf you would have told me that was possible two decades ago, there is no world in which I would have believed you. You might not even believe me right now.\n\nBut, it is true. And it was a Graceful Awakening like no other.\n\nAs they say in the East, a meeting with the Divine and the rivers changes course.\n\nI came to understand (pun kind of intended) that we are incarnate to experience what it means to be human. And deep, dark, intense emotion is part of that experience.\n\nOur soul (aka the magnetic monopole) desires the WHOLE experience, not just the parts that our minds have come to judge as \u201cright.\u201d\n\nIt would be dishonest to say that I\u2019m perfect at allowing my emotions. I\u2019m definitely not.\n\nThe metaphor of personal growth being like an onion didn\u2019t become a cliche for no reason. There are always new layers to explore and more subtle realms to play in.\n\nBut I am forever changed and have developed a curiosity about my emotions that just wasn\u2019t possible before. I\u2019ve given myself deeper permission to allow my feelings to flow, to trust their wisdom, and to stay present even when it becomes very intense.\n\nI now know, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that I can not only handle my emotions but also revel in them.\n\nThe possibilities are endless, and I can give my soul what it desires more than anything else \u2013 depth, richness, and intensity.\n\nThis is an amazing part of being fully alive, and I\u2019m here for it. And if you have been resistant to your emotions, I encourage you to open up to the idea that you can revel in them, too.\n\n## Affirmations for Human Design Gate 30\n\nUsing your Human Design to create affirmations is a powerful way to activate the full potential of your chart.

Gate 31 knows deep in its bones that empowered people empower others. Disempowered people disempower others. With this as its baseline, it is able to be a highly influential force of nature by expressing the possibilities and potentials for a brighter future for everyone.\n\nOn the \u201cnegative\u201d end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 31 is the energy for being afraid to step into the role of leader or believing that you are unworthy of being a leader. It can easily use its influence and authority to manipulate others for its own personal gain. Or try to force its vision on others.\n\nYou\u2019ll learn about the surprising (but most effective) way to raise your energy frequency in theHuman Design Map + Portal.\n\nThe most important thing to raise the frequency of gate 31 is to lead with integrity by knowing your leadership niche. Your Human Design will offer clues in this, especially your conscious sun and yourGene Keys prosperity sequence(unconscious mars, conscious Jupiter, unconscious Jupiter).\n\n### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 31 (Gene Key 31)\n\nThe channel of the Alpha (31-7) is defined in my chart.\n\nGate 31 is defined in my unconscious Saturn.\n\nAnd, in an interesting twist of fate, Human Design Gate 7 is defined in my conscious Saturn.\n\nHow fun?!?!\n\nEh. Not so much.\n\nSaturn is often a challenge in our charts.\n\nIf Santa Claus were divided into two parts of our chart, he would be Jupiter and Saturn.\n\nJupiter is the benevolent, jolly, grandfather-like energy bringing all the gifts. Saturn is the one checking the list twice.\n\nIn other words, Saturn is where we have to check ourselves.\n\nIt is a place where we have abundant potential for mastery and transcendence. But only through conscious self-discipline.\n\nAnd, if you are anything like me, even the mere concept of discipline feels triggering. (Rage?!?!)\n\nI am a free spirit who wants to do what I want whenever I want to do it. Discipline tastes bitter and doesn\u2019t go down smoothly.\n\nBut Saturn gives no fucks about how it tastes going down, and if we want the bounty of Jupiter, we must heed his call.\n\nDuring my first Saturn return, I was just getting clean from drugs, one of my brothers died, and I fell head over heels in love with a narcissistic asshole.\n\nIt was a time of great trials, and when my heart began to crack open and see that I have so much more potential than abuse, addiction, and people-pleasing. I can see Leo\u2019s threads running through it. (Both gates 31 and 7 are in the sign of Leo.)\n\nAt the time of this writing, my second Saturn return is a handful of years away. With each passing day, I\u2019m checking myself, becoming clearer and clearer about what I need to master to receive my bounty. And it has everything to do with being an Alpha.\n\nTruth be told, I love talking about my other defined channels:\n\nThe channel of the Wavelength (48-16) gives me the energy to empower the collective by diving deep into the things I am interested in and bringing them out into the world masterfully.\n\nThe channel of the Brain Wave (57-20) gives me the energy to empower myself and others by trusting my intuitive wisdom and giving voice to Truth.The channel of Awareness (61-24) gives me the energy to empower myself and others by asking the big questions in life, like why we are here and allowing the magick of silence to reveal the answers.\n\nLove. Love. Love.\n\nBut it\u2019s a whole other story when we get to the channel of the Alpha (7-31). This channel gives me the energy to empower the collective by being a leader rooted in a higher vision of equity, empowerment, and self-awareness.\n\nAnd, while it has never been a secret to me that others see me as a leader, I\u2019ve mostly not wanted anything to do with it.\n\nPerhaps it has been my 5\/2 profile + innocence motivation +gate 7on the conscious side, but I\u2019d rather stay out of the spotlight.\n\nBut, in early 2022, something shifted, and I\u2019ll never forget it. I checked myself in the best kind of ways.\n\nI was taking a class for Human Design Projectors, and the energy around leadership kept coming up. In the class, I felt incredibly vulnerable and seen in a way I had never before.\n\nI cannot even describe what it was like to have 13 Projectors looking deeply into my soul simultaneously.\n\nIn that space, I was called on to be a leader on numerous occasions. I was asked to speak about this or that topic, and with each invitation, I had zero doubt that I had some magic to bring to the conversation.\n\nIn hindsight, this was how I felt when I started writing the very firstmapI ever made. I felt my natural leadership come alive.\n\nYes, it was a remarkably vulnerable feeling. I felt exposed and raw.\n\nBut there was also a quality of integrity and synchronicity\u2014beautiful timing and just oh so right.\n\nThe highest potential vibration of the 31-7 was so deeply activated within me that I could no longer push it away. I had to see it. It wasn\u2019t just theoretical anymore.\n\nIt was trustworthy.\n\nI AM an Alpha.\n\nThe key for me was therecognitionof leading from a space of deep integrity, of that inner knowing that I was the one to guide the ship.\n\nIn the past, I\u2019ve often been nominated to lead things that didn\u2019t land right with me.\n\nMy spleen would scream no, and, again, maybe my 5\/2 was playing a big part here, but I believed that my job was to do whatever people expected of me. And if that meant leading in ways that didn\u2019t feel right for me but helped others, I would just do it anyway.\n\nAnd true to what Human Design (and theGene Keys) teaches us about gate 31, stepping into the role of the leader has to be a two-way street.\n\n(Just like theprojector recognition and invitation!)\n\nWhen I am trying to lead shit that doesn\u2019t need or want my leadership, it doesn\u2019t end well. And vice versa, when others want me to lead, and my body says no, it also doesn\u2019t end well.\n\nSince the sacred container of that class, I have been able to step into the role of a win-win leader on many occasions.\n\nI often feel this way in interactions inside theHuman DesignMap portal,in situations where my expertise and insight perfectly match the path ahead.\n\nI even had a dream about someone I care about. From the dream, I knew that I needed to take the lead on a real-life situation we were going through.\n\nIt was crystalline clear.\u00a0 So, I did.\n\nThe results were stunning. I lead the situation into more profound harmony and alignment for everyone.\n\nAnd, because it\u2019s Saturn, I know I\u2019ll be checking myself for years to come. I\u2019ll revisit the 31 and the 7 until I take off the tight shoe called life.\n\nBut I have developed an awareness of what this energy looks and feels like on \u201cboth sides\u201d of the spectrum.\n\nI know what it\u2019s like to try to lead when I\u2019m not recognized and invited.\n\nI know what it\u2019s like to lead even when I don\u2019t want to.\n\nAnd, through the diligence of Saturn, I also know what it\u2019s like to lead when it\u2019s win-win.\n\nSo, now, I practice. And, perhaps one day, will truly master.\n\nIf you are ready to surrender to the bounty in your chart, you will love theHuman Design Map & Portal.It\u2019s a two-part experience in which you\u2019ll learn the most important parts of your Human Design and be expertly guided on an awakening journey of overcoming people-pleasing, making radically authentic decisions, and, above all, trusting yourself.Get yours here.\n\n## Affirmations for Human Design Gate 31\n\nUsing your Human Design to create affirmations is a powerful way to activate the full potential of your chart.

It can isolate itself from its family, friends, or community due to a belief that you must go through life alone. Or become immersed in groupthink, cults, or fundamentalist systems that reject the outer or natural world.\n\nYou\u2019ll learn about the surprising (but most effective) way to raise your energy frequency in theHuman Design Map + Portal.\n\nIn the meantime, start noticing when you are feeling OCD, cultish or like a know it all but don\u2019t be an asshole to yourself. Treat yourself the way you would a small child \u2013 with love, curiosity, and understanding.\n\n### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 32 (Gene Key 32)\n\nLike most of the tribalhuman design circuitry, Gate 32 is undefined in my chart. In fact, relative to my individual and collective circuitry, I have very little tribal definition in my chart.\n\nAfter many years of deconditioning, through Human Design and otherwise, I\u2019ve come to understand that I\u2019ve never really valued being part of a group. My attachment to being liked was more about who I thought I should be, rather than what actually feels true for me.\n\nI would even go so far as to say that groups are hard for me. I thrive 1:1 but become easily overwhelmed when in a group environment.\n\nOther than mymapportal community, where I am the \u201cleader\u201d, I mostly find myself \u201con the edge\u201d groups and rarely feel \u201cpart\u201d of them.\n\nThat is especially true in groups where the \u201cleaders\u201d are put on pedestals and worshiped or where you \u201chave to\u201d believe and value the same things to be accepted. That kind of thinking has never really made sense to me. My autonomy has always been more important than group think.\n\nFor a long time, I made that mean that something was wrong with me, that I was unlikable, or that I was a \u201cbad\u201d person.\n\nAnd I can see the threads of Gate 32 running all through it.\n\nWhen we were cavepeople, we lived in small, close knit communities, often of only around 100 people.\n\nEveryone played a role in the survival of its tribe. If you couldn\u2019t play your given role, you were banished and left to die alone.\n\nIn other words, success was dependent on the group structure and failure meant imminent death.\n\nThis has created a deep lineage of fear around belonging and a world where groupthink is revered.\n\nBut, the world is changing; we are moving into a new aeon.\n\nWe are headed into a time where true success is dependent on individual empowerment rather than blind adherence. And it is why I am so honored to do the work I do with theHuman Design Map.\n\nWe, you and me, are the leading edge of this change. And I am here for it.\n\nNow, of course, doesn\u2019t mean that groups, families, or communities are dying all together. In fact, I think we are seeing them begin to take shape in whole new ways.\n\nThe old structures that have been held up by dogma, echo chambers, and authoritarian leadership are crumbling.\n\nThey are being rebuilt with the well-being of individuals in mind. We are moving into the awareness that a group of empowered individuals is actually stronger than ones made of disempowered people.\n\nWhen I look at my experience with the group structures in my life, I can see that my definition of success was always rooted in individual empowerment.\n\nAnd, on some level, I\u2019ve always trusted that empowered individuals create empowered groups, and empowered groups create an empowered collective.\n\nI don\u2019t have the energy to surrender to groupthink, fundamentalism, or \u201cleader\u201d worship. And, if that means staying on the edges, so be it.\u00a0I\u2019d rather be inside themapportal blazing a new trail of empowered individuals, anyway. That is what success means to me.\n\n## Affirmations for Human Design Gate 32\n\nUsing your Human Design to create affirmations is a powerful way to activate the full potential of your chart.

Gate 33 believes that there is beauty in all things, including painful memories from the past. If you are only willing to see it, and will allow it, experiences and memories of the past can be alchemized into wisdom.\n\nOn the \u201cnegative\u201d end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 33 is the energy for isolation or hiding from the world, especially when the wisdom of harmful collective events has not revealed itself yet. It can act out of fear or anger in an attempt to force wisdom onto others or throw the past into the faces of others.\n\nYou\u2019ll learn about the surprising (but most effective) way to raise your energy frequency in theHuman Design Map + Portal.\n\nThe most important thing to raise the frequency of gate 33 is to learn how to hold space for the discomfort that comes from waiting for the wisdom of the past to reveal itself.\n\n### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 33 (Gene Key 33)\n\nGate 33 is in the throat center of the Human Design chart. When we are looking at the throat center, we are always looking at how the energy that swirls around inside of us (thoughts, memories, visions, feelings, emotions, intuition, instincts) manifest in the outer world; it\u2019s the impact our words and actions have on the people, places, and things around us.\n\nAnd while \u201cimpact\u201d and the throat center are often associated with Manifestor types in Human Design, the throat center actually reveals a different story.\n\nMost of the gates in the throat are, in fact,projected energy.Human Design Gate 20is a bit of an oddball because while inprojector typesit is projected, it is also one part of the only manifesting generating channel, the 34-20.\n\nTo me, as a Projector type with a heavily defined throat, that tells us something important about the throat andhowit impacts the world.\n\nAll types of energy \u2013 projected, manifested, and generated (via mani gen) \u2013 reveal themselves to the world through the throat.\u00a0 And, at its core, all throat energy is about transformation, which is distinct from evolution.\n\nEvolution happens in the root center of the Human Design chart. It\u2019s about how our genes \u2013 the blueprint of our bodies \u2013 change over long periods of time. It is the adaptations that ensure our survival in the sometimes very harsh climates of Earth.\n\nTransformation, on the other hand, is more rapid and is about the spiritual structures that underpin how we show up in the world.\n\nTo take this even a bit further, if we look at the throat center in the context of its correspondences to the Kabbalah Tree of Life, we see that it corresponds to the invisible sphere on the tree known as Daath.\n\nIn High Magick circles, when our consciousness rises to the level of Daath, it is called crossing the abyss.\n\nCrossing the abyss isthe momentwe become aware that we are one with the Divine. Not just theoretically aware, either. It is an awareness that you can no longer forget. And itrequiresyou to walk very differently in the world when you know thateverything is you.\n\nSpiritually speaking, it is the \u201cfinal frontier\u201d on the way to embodying unity consciousness (aka enlightenment) the way masters like Jesus, Buddha, Krishna, etc did.\n\nEnlightenment occurs in Kether, which corresponds to the head center in Human Design. The space between Daath and Kether removes the miniscule specks of dust off the mirror of your consciousness and makes it pristinely clean.\n\nAnd, that brings me back to gate 33 and its pivotal role in our spiritual transformation.\n\nGate 33 is undefined in my chart, which means it is a place of amplifying patterns, learning, and letting go of attachment. It is (hopefully!) a place wherewise usewill become the norm.\n\nWhether that happens for me in this lifetime or not, what I can say for sure is that it is crystal clear to me that the world desperately needs the brilliance of Gate 33.\n\nWe, as a collective, are starting to become aware of how trauma from the past holds us back in the present. Unhealed trauma not only puts a halt on our evolution as a species, but also our transformation as souls.\n\nIt is obvious to me that if we don\u2019t have the capacity to process the wild and twisted shit that happens in this world, we stay stuck. And here is the critical part \u2013 we cannot do that alone. We need others to hold space for us in the processing.\n\nAnd most of the people alive right now never had that. The high frequencies of gate 33 have been sorely missing.\n\nWe\u2019ve been so stuck in survival most that our culture pushes \u201cgetting over it\u201d, moving on, and candy-coated forgiveness. And that just makes things worse.\n\nWe need safe space to breathe, reflect, and process. We must rebuild trust with our body, nervous system, and authentic emotions.\n\nWe need to feel seen, heard, and understood in our vulnerability. We need support and people who are willing to hold healing space, rather than to try to jump in and \u201cfix\u201d things.\n\nAnd that is what gate 33 does.\n\nI am grateful for the people in my life that can hold that kind of space for me. I absolutely would not be where I am today without them. And, it is my intention to hold that kind of space inside theHuman Design Map portal, too.\n\nAt its core, Human Design is a path of transformation. And we have to confront some big truths when we make the holy decision to trust ourselves and our inner wisdom as the north star of our lives.And whether our journey involves Human Design or not, it is not about just moving on from the past. It\u2019s about moving through. It is about being present with yourself, and being witnessed, as you peel the layers and let go of the fear, the anger, and the shame.\n\nIt takes courage. And compassion. And an immense capacity to feel all of the things.\n\nMy deepest prayer is that, as a society, we aren\u2019t just evolving, but also transforming. I hope that we will come to undoubtedly understand that traumatized people cannot expand into the most aligned version of themselves. And that what the world needs most is more people who are walking the path of surrendered alignment.\n\nI can see it happening. In some circles, it\u2019s even cool to talk about trauma and healing wounds from the past.\n\nIn the meantime, I\u2019ll be over here healing my shit, leaning on the people who know how to hold space, and doing the same for others (here).You can\u2019t rush your healingDarkness has its teachingLove is never leavingYou can\u2019t rush your healingTrevor Hall, You Can\u2019t Rush Your Healing, Kala\n\n## Affirmations for Human Design Gate 33\n\nUsing your Human Design to create affirmations is a powerful way to activate the full potential of your chart.

The 34 empowers you to cultivate inner strength, faith, and flow to make your visions a reality.\n\nOn the \u201cnegative\u201d end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 34 is the energy for pushing or forcing your dreams into reality. A lack of clear vision can make the 34 feel drained of time, energy, and resources.\n\nYou\u2019ll learn about the surprising (but most effective) way to raise your energy frequency in theHuman Design Map + Portal.\n\nIn the meantime, start noticing when you are feeling shy, busy or visionless but don\u2019t be an asshole to yourself. Treat yourself the way you would a small child \u2013 with love, curiosity, and understanding.\n\n### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 34 (Gene Key 34)\n\nGate 34, located in thesacral center, isundefinedin my chart; that means it\u2019s an archetype that reveals a lot of wisdom in my life. And due to the specificmechanicsof my design, it is a place where I get a lot of opportunities to become wiser. \ud83d\ude02\n\nIn my chart provided above, you\u2019ll notice the 57-20 channel of the Brainwave is defined and the way that interacts with gate 34 has a few layers.\n\nI won\u2019t get into all of them here. For now, the place I want to point out is thathuman design Gate 57is the gate defined in the conscious sun of myincarnation cross.\n\nBeing 70% of your energy, the conscious sun is the most important gate in your chart; it\u2019s the key archetype you are here to become adept in.\u00a0Your conscious sunpolishes the mirrorof your soul like nothing else.\n\nSo, with gate 57 in my conscious sun, an important part of my incarnation is to become adept in trusting my intuition and creating a life that fosters intuitive clarity.\u00a0And, as a projector type, soak in the recognition I receive when others benefit from my clarity.\n\nBut despite what you may have been taught by new-age or religious rhetoric, becoming adept is never about bypassing the \u201clow\u201d or \u201cnegative\u201d side of thespectrum.\n\nYour conscious sun is not supposed to be all rainbows and butterflies. Because everything going perfectly isn\u2019t how you become adept at something.\n\nProwess with any energy, not just thehuman design gates, is about integration of all its parts (not just the \u201cgood\u201d parts) and integrations naturally leads to the ability to consciously direct energy in an aligned way.\n\nThis is one of the many reasons why I love Human Design and what I do inside theHuman Design Mapportal. The Human Design system gives you amapthat points you in the direction of your natural prowess.\n\nWhen you are looking at your design in an objective and empowered way, you will clearly see where you are bypassing instead of integrating your most potent sources of energy.\n\nIn themapportal, I show you \u201chow\u201d to integrate and reclaim all of that energy in a skillful and conscious way. (Hint: it happens through radical self acceptance, self-worth, and valuing yourself!)\n\nAnyway, back to my experience with the electromagnetics of gate 34 and the 57 in my conscious sun.\n\nWhat I\u2019ve learned through experience is that becoming wise with gate 34\u2019s energy is an important part of being adept at trusting my intuition and making space for intuitive clarity.\n\nWhether I am encountering someone with gate 34 defined, or it\u2019s active in the transits, learning how to be powerful and sovereign seems to be a key for fostering intuitive clarity.\n\nLike I talk about in the 36 channels course (inside theHuman Design Mapportal), each end of a channel offers balance to the other side.\n\nChannels are kind of like peanut butter and jelly. Peanut butter and jelly are both delicious on their own. But bring them together and the balance of salty, sweet, earthy, and light is why kids all over the US have them in their lunch boxes.\n\nThe 34 and 57 balance and harmonize one another.\n\nIf I am giving my sovereignty away, there is no way I will make the space in my life that is necessary to be a clear channel for Divine Clarity.\n\nIf I don\u2019t have a deep understanding of my vision, I won\u2019t be able to hear what it\u2019s telling me.\n\nAnd if I believe I am powerless in places where I am actually full of power (aka capacity to do something), I will never trust myself and the voice of my intuition.\n\nWhat beautiful wisdom, indeed.\n\nI am grateful to say that I\u2019ve known some amazing people with the 34definedin their charts. And with every encounter, I am learning more and more about what it means to be powerful in my intuitive clarity.\n\nHow does it get any better than that?\n\n## Affirmations for Human Design Gate 34\n\nUsing your Human Design to create affirmations is a powerful way to activate the full potential of your chart. Here are some affirmations for Gate 34:\n\nI am sovereign.\n\nAll things are possible.\n\nI am powerful AF.\n\nInside yourHuman Design Map, you\u2019ll get a full list of empowering beliefs for your type + strategy, authority, profile, and all four gates of yourincarnation crossand show you how to go from affirmation to full-on embodiment.

Where are you headed? What are you creating with your life force energy?\n\nWhen you have so much faith in your vision becoming real that it\u2019s as good as done in heart and mind, what actions do you take? What energy do you bring to the way you move through your days? What is your way of BEING in the world?\n\nWhat are your indicators of right timing? What ways does the Divine wink and nudge you along?\n\nAnd, most importantly, are you willing to surrender to your magic? Are you truly open to miracles?\n\nThese questions are a good reminder for me. And I hope that they will be powerful for you as well.\n\nI encourage you to take some time with them.

The unsatisfied hunger for adventure can lead to overdoing things like filling sex, food, drugs, alcohol, scroll holes, information seeking, etc. With those emotional buffers in place, Gate 35 struggles to learn from life.\n\nYou\u2019ll learn about the surprising (but most effective) way to raise your energy frequency in theHuman Design Map + Portal.\n\nIn the meantime, start noticing when you are overindulging in food, drink, drugs, sex, etc. but don\u2019t be an asshole to yourself. Treat yourself the way you would a small child \u2013 with love, curiosity, and understanding.\n\n### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 35 (Gene Key 35)\n\nGate 35 is undefined in my chart, but I had a private client for many years who has the full 35-36 channel of transitoriness. (Side note: because I always get asked \u2014 I no longer see clients privately. As of now, I only offer theHuman Design Map & Portal.)\n\nShe originally came to my work when I was doing body image-focused coaching, and what an adventure it was.\n\nThe most important work we ever did together was giving her the tools and creating the space for her to become present with her emotions and take responsibility for them. As time passed, she developed a level of emotional maturity that I will forever be in awe of.\n\nThrough the same tools I teach inHuman Design Map & Portaltoday, she learned how to:\n\n\ud83d\udd25 process her emotions\ud83d\udd25 access the wisdom inside of them\ud83d\udd25 heal the \u201cblocks\u201d to honoring that wisdom.\n\nWith that solid emotional foundation, I had the honor and pleasure of witnessing her Gate 35 come to life.\n\nThe longer we worked together, the deeper and richer our conversations became. We navigated intense emotional situations with immense Grace and worked through things she didn\u2019t believe were possible.\n\nThe thing that I loved most was her insatiable hunger for more.\n\nShe was always ready to go on an adventure of the mind, emotions, and soul. Her curiosity was delightfully endless. She genuinely wanted the adventure of the experience and had little attachment to where we ended up.\n\nWhen I originally wrote this gate 35 contemplation, the full circle of our time together hit me like a ton of bricks.\n\nIronically, one of the first programs I guided her through wasHungry For More.\n\nAt the time, I knew nothing about Human Design. I didn\u2019t know that my intuitive understanding of energy had numbers, keynotes, and archetypal names.\n\nBut I did understand Alchemy. And that our so-called \u201cbad\u201d habits are often the result of a deeper hunger. A hunger that cannot be filled by food, drugs, sex, or scroll holes.\n\nI knew that the more willing we are to own and honor those true hungers, the more satisfied, successful, peaceful, and delighted we feel.\n\nAnd I knew that our emotions are messengers that show up along the way. (This is true no matter your solar plexus definition \u2014 emotion (energy in motion) happens all over the chart.)\n\nWhen we lean into our emotions and trust the wisdom inside of them, we unlock the adventures we long for. We have the fuel necessary to go out there and live life to the fullest\u2014whatever that means for us. We begin to understand that we are spiritual beings having a human experience and that it is meant to be a game, not a torture chamber.\n\nAs I\u2019ve often discussed with my \u200bHuman Design Map\u200b people, emotions are a source of energy (in motion)\u2014one of the things that makes life do what it does. The adventure unfolds when we allow that to happen.\n\nWhat a beautiful lesson for me to learn and witness. She taught me so much, and I am so much wiser because of it.\n\nI\u2019m still in touch with her today. I am grateful to have watched her step into such a beautiful expression of the 35-36. She will go down in history as one of my life\u2019s most significant client relationships.\n\nHere\u2019s to the adventure of life.\n\n## Affirmations for Human Design Gate 35\n\nUsing your Human Design to create affirmations is a powerful way to activate the full potential of your chart.

It can lead to beating yourself up, holding yourself to impossible (emotional or sexual) standards, and feelings of inadequacy.

Treat yourself the way you would a small child \u2013 with love, curiosity, and understanding.\n\n### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 36 (Gene Key 36)\n\nGate 36 is undefined in my chart. As such, learning to be compassionate, with myself and others, has been a key source of life lessons.\n\nAbout 15 years ago, I\u2019d been clean (from drugs) for a few years. But I was starting to see that I had simply traded drugs for food.\n\nI was binging almost every single day and hated myself to the core. I deeply believed that I was inherently flawed and broken beyond repair.\n\nThankfully, through several synchronicities, I found myself in a group treatment program (outpatient) for eating disorders.\n\nWe were often given homework; the first assignment was to start noticing how we spoke to ourselves.\n\nAt that point, I hadn\u2019t done any training in coaching or energy healing. I didn\u2019t know how the brain worked, I assumed that thoughts and feelings were the same things, and I was in deep denial of my intuition.\n\nI thought my emotions were \u201cthe truth\u201d of who I really was.\n\nTo say that I was in for a rude awakening would be the understatement of the century.\n\nWhen I started actually paying attention to what I was thinking about myself, I noticed that I\u2019d regularly call myself a fat pig, lazy, and good-for-nothing.\n\nThat was illuminating. I had no idea how mean I\u2019d been to myself for so long.\n\nBut the real awakening was realizing I had a choice in how I thought about myself\u2014my thoughts are my free will.\n\nAnd while I understand that traditional Human Design doesn\u2019t \u201cbelieve in\u201d free will, there is absolutely no denying that we can choose and change how we think about anything. That is just a scientific fact.\n\n(Showing you what to actually do to change the way you think of yourself is at the heart of what I do inside theHuman Design Map portal.)\n\nFor me, realizing that my thoughts were a choice was a pivotal moment in my life. And the idea that I could infuse my thoughts with compassion for myself was nothing short of a miracle.\n\nBut, like most people who are steeped in the self-hatred tea, I didn\u2019t really know what it meant to \u201cbe\u201d compassionate.\n\nAnd I honestly spent years trying to figure it out.\n\nI can\u2019t say that I have it 100% figured out. Because, well, the game of life is no fun without contrast.\n\nBut it is one of my key practices.\n\nI\u2019ve learned that compassion, whether for ourselves or others, is about having anembodiedunderstanding that we are human beings.\n\nWe are all a mix of shadow and light, high frequencies and low frequencies, conscious and unconscious.\n\nAnd we can choose that perspective for anyone at any time and in any situation \u2013 yourself and your darkest secrets included.\n\nTo be clear \u2013 choosing compassion isn\u2019t about spiritual bypassing.\n\nIt is about embracing all your parts, being present with your humanity, and honoring who you must become to find the compassion that already dwells within you.\n\nThis involves a lot of shadow work (something I teach to myHuman Design Mapclients) and pulling out the roots of your compassionless stories.\n\nAnd the ripple effects of that practice really are a miracle.\n\nIt automatically flows into the other side as we practice compassion for ourselves or others.\n\nWhen I can be compassionate for your humanity, I surrender to mine. When I can be compassionate for my humanity, I surrender to yours.\n\nIt can only work that way.\n\nAnd if you\u2019ve read this far, I\u2019m sure that you can agree that the world needs a little more of that.\n\n## Affirmations for Human Design Gate 36\n\nUsing your Human Design to create affirmations is a powerful way to activate the full potential of your chart.

Treat yourself the way you would a small child \u2013 with love, curiosity, and understanding.\n\n### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 37 (Gene Key 37)\n\nGate 37 is undefined in my chart, but I have a wild number of significant relationships with people with the 37-40 channel defined.\n\nBecause I have been exposed to it, often daily, I have come to understand thefull spectrumof its expression and am heading its wisdom.\n\nGate 37 is part ofthe tribal circuit, which focuses on what is \u201cright\u201d for the family, community, or group. I only have hanging gates in the tribal circuit; all of my channels are a mix ofindividualandcollective circuitry(two in each).\n\n(I do a deep dive into channels and circuits inside the portal of theHuman Design Map.)\n\nI\u2019ve never felt like it was my job to ensure a family, community, or group stays together. In fact, the majority of my adult life has been in estrangement from most of my family.\n\nBut, I have developed relationships with people who are my \u201cchosen family.\u201d And what I have learned over time is that the full spectrum of gate 37 is truly magnificent energy.\n\nYes, gate 37 can be hella controlling and codependent AF on one side of the spectrum.\n\nBut, it also has the capacity for deep empathy, mutual respect, and understanding that empowered individuals actually are what make an empowered family or group.\n\nThe higher purpose of gate 37 is to embody healthy boundaries, communicate clearly, and have an attitude of cooperation instead of codependence. I\u2019ve seen that it can find a win-win in even the most challenging family dynamics. And will set firmer boundaries when necessary.\n\nIn recent years, numerous people have told me they admire my boundaries and how I communicate during challenges. They have even said that I\u2019m graceful with my boundaries and willingness to communicate; hearing that shocks me every time.\n\nBecause, uh, it rarely feels graceful on the inside.\n\nI vividly remember one of the first firm boundaries I ever set.\n\nI literally yelled at a family member to get the fuck out of my house.\n\nI swam in shame for days after that.\n\nI eventually apologized for yelling but made it clear that the boundary stands. Their behavior was not, and will never be, welcome in my home.\n\nI learned so much from that experience.\n\nFirst of all, the boundary nor the shame killed me.\n\nThat sounds like a joke, but when we hold such deep conditioning, the nervous system interprets stepping outside the norm as a literal threat to survival. Understanding that is an essential part ofdeconditioning.\n\nIn that experience, I also learned to love the part of me that can be an asshole sometimes. It\u2019s the part of me that stands for what I believe in, is clear about my values, and has no problem saying what is true for me.\u00a0(Gate 49!)\n\nAnd just like I teach myHuman Design Mapclients, the key is learning to love and value those taboo parts of ourselves. We can channel those parts consciously instead of letting them leak out sideways and causing all manner of chaos in our lives.\n\nAs I\u2019ve become more in touch with my boundaries and have stopped being so afraid of being seen as an asshole or bitch for having them, I have become a bit more graceful with them.\n\nI can be clear and do so in a way that honors what is true without being unnecessarily unkind. And, when the situation calls for it, I can also go into straight-up bitch mode without shame.\n\nIt still feels uncomfortable sometimes. And, from time to time, I need to be reminded that boundaries are a beautiful thing.\n\nBut I have it deep in my bones that healthy boundaries and communication are possible in relationships. I\u2019ve had too many positive experiences with my boundaries to believe otherwise.\n\nThese days, because I have shored up so many of the blatantly apparent boundaries, the work is more subtle. There is more nuance and a requirement to go deeper under the surface than my initial anger or defensiveness.\n\nBut it is worth doing, and I\u2019m grateful to bear witness to the people who\u2019ve embodied the highest frequency of gate 37. Even if it means becoming BFFs with my inner bitch.\n\nIf you want to become BFFs with your inner bitch so that you can set healthy boundaries, too, I\u2019ll show you how inside theHuman Design Map + Portal.\n\n## Affirmations for Human Design Gate 37\n\nUsing your Human Design to create affirmations is a powerful way to activate the full potential of your chart.

The 38 enjoys the pressure (created by the root center) to evolve and make life meaningful. It is the energy to fight for what is \u201cright.\u201d\n\nOn the \u201cnegative\u201d end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 38 is the energy for fighting for the sake of fighting and can have a tendency to believe that life is meant to be an unhealthy struggle.\n\nYou\u2019ll learn about the surprising (but most effective) way to raise your energy frequency in theHuman Design Map + Portal.\n\nIn the meantime, start noticing when you are feeling stressed, reactive or like a coward but don\u2019t be an asshole to yourself. Treat yourself the way you would a small child \u2013 with love, curiosity, and understanding.\n\n### My Personal Experience with Human Design Gate 38 (Gene Key 38)\n\nGate 38 isundefinedin my chart but my husband has it defined in his conscious earth, which means it\u2019s the energy that grounds him. And sinceHuman Design Gate 28is defined in my chart (4 times!), we create the whole channel of struggle together.\n\nAnd I can confidently say that my husband has both practically and energetically taught me so much about suffering and struggling.\u00a0Not because he is so much better or worse at it than I am, but because it has been such a potent mirror for how I show up in the face of struggle.\n\n(That\u2019s the way all \u201cattraction\u201d channels work in Human Design, the other person because a mirror for how we handle the undefined side in our own design. And through that, we become wiser in that specific energy.)\n\nIn my relationship with him, I\u2019ve very clearly seen the conditioning that leads me to believe that suffering and struggle are noble.\n\nIn our current culture, we worship at the altar of suffering and struggle.\n\nWe often coalesce around the fires of complaining, one-upping our problems, and making sure everyone knows what a victim we are to the shit sandwiches of life.\n\nWe use complaining as a shitty substitute for connection and true intimacy. Sometimes, venting our woe-is-me stories is the backbone of our closest relationships.\n\nSuffering and struggle have become a badge of honor.\n\nMy suffering badge of honor took the form of believing that I was meant to be a dumping ground for bullshit.\n\nAs a5\/2 profile, people often saw me as someone who could save them, and I believed them. And I thought that, somehow, this made me a good and worthy human.\n\nBut, in walks my husband, and everything changes.\n\nWith definedintegration channelsin his design, he operates differently than anyone I\u2019ve ever known.\n\n(I teach a deep dive on all 36 channels inside theHuman Design Mapportal.Get yours here.)\n\nOur relationship has challenges, of course, but he has never been one to assume that I\u2019ll clean up any metaphorical messes he has made with his life. In fact, the opposite has been true.\n\nAnd that provided a potent mirror for my healing.\n\nHis way of being, combined with understanding myhuman design profile, showed me how deeply I was creating unnecessary suffering by trying to swoop in to save a day that didn\u2019t need saving.\n\nAs I peeled back those layers, I started to see the beauty of gate 38. It is truly magical and has taught me so much.\n\nSome say that we \u201cmust\u201d struggle \u2013 that life is a struggle. Others say that suffering is optional or simply a state of mind.\n\nAnd while there is at least a little truth in every cliche, it isn\u2019t so black and white. There is nuance and many shades of gray.\n\nGate 38 invites us to look under the surface of our struggles, suffering, and victim mindset.\n\n(I\u2019m not talking about actual victims of crimes, etc. I\u2019m talking about the mindset that you are a victim of life itself.)\n\nSuffering doesn\u2019t mean we are doing life right or wrong. It isn\u2019t that we should or shouldn\u2019t struggle. And being honest and vulnerable about where we actually are in our lives is a beautiful thing.\n\nIt isn\u2019t about judging ourselves (or others) at all.\n\n(Removing judgment and replacing it with curiosity is a huge part of deconditioning and is the foundation of what I teach you in theHuman Design MapPortal.)\n\nInstead, when we are deep in the throes of struggle, with no end in sight, it\u2019s a sign that we are putting unnecessary pressure on ourselves to be a certain way.\n\nUsually, that pressure comes in the form of automatically making our situation mean something terrible about ourselves or life (gate 28) and fighting for something that isn\u2019t real or doesn\u2019t actually matter.\n\nAnd in that state of stress, we forget the magick of who we really are.\n\nBut when we go within and become present with any sense of struggle, suffering, and victimhood, our bodies will show us what is worth fighting for and what isn\u2019t.\n\nAnd, in my book, knowing your Divinity is worth fighting for.\n\nThe right amount of pressure isn\u2019t a built-in recipe for struggle.\n\nWhen it\u2019s the right amount for you, it won\u2019t weigh you down; it will move you deeper into recognizing your Divine Nature. It can help you find yourself in the Divine game of hide-and-seek.\n\nAnd finding that just right amount of pressure is all part of the fun.\n\nI\u2019ll teach you the \u201chow\u201d inside theHuman Design Mapportal.\n\n## Affirmations for Human Design Gate 38\n\nUsing your Human Design to create affirmations is a powerful way to activate the full potential of your chart. Here are some affirmations for Gate 38:\n\nI have a warrior\u2019s spirit.\n\nI love a good challenge.\n\nI fight for the things that are worth fighting for.\n\nInside yourHuman Design Map, you\u2019ll get a full list of empowering beliefs for your type + strategy, authority, profile, and all four gates of yourincarnation crossand show you how to go from affirmation to full-on embodiment.

Its most sacred gift is provoking heightened states of emotional and spiritual awareness.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 39 is the energy for taking responsibility for other people\u2019s emotions and being a people pleaser. It can intentionally push other people\u2019s buttons in revenge or as an attempt to hurt people.\n\nYou\u2019ll learn about the surprising (but most effective) way to raise your energy frequency in theHuman Design Map + Portal.\n\nIn the meantime, start noticing when you are feeling heartless, evil or offensive but don\u2019t be an asshole to yourself. Treat yourself the way you would a small child \u2013 with love, curiosity, and understanding.\n\n### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 39 (Gene Key 39)\n\nWith the full57\/20, I often sit with things for a while before fully expressing them. And that is exactly what happened when I was contemplating this gate.\n\nGate 39 is undefined in my chart, but my husband has it in his conscious sun.\n\nSo, when I first started writing this post, I thought the words would just flow out of me.\n\nBut by the mystery of Grace, that isn\u2019t what happened. I was provoked into something deeper and more clarifying.\n\nI had an intuitive knowing that something was \u201ccoming through\u201d the 57\/20 and that I just needed to be present until the words popped in.\n\nThen, shortly after the witching hour on the day of the original writing, I was struck by the etymology of the word:\n\nProvocation.\n\nProis a word element that meansforward, forth, toward the front.\n\nVocationhas a couple of different meanings but the roots of it arecall or calling.\n\nIn the Gene Keys, there is a placement in thePearl Sequencecalled vocation which is also the core wound in theVenus Sequence.\n\n(If you are in business, you\u2019ll learn how this placement relates to your audience and marketing inside theHuman Design Mapportal.)\n\nThe Gene Keys \u201cvocation\u201d and \u201ccore wound\u201d correspond to the unconscious Mars placement in the Human Design chart. When we heal the core relational wound, it awakens our life calling and becomes our vocation.\n\nMy unconscious Mars placement is gate 59 line 5. Human Design Gate 59 is the gate of \u201cdispersion\u201d and is all about breaking down the walls to intimacy and vulnerability.\n\nMars is where we \u201cmust\u201d express energy outward like an arrow. It can be aggressive and passionate. And if we don\u2019t express the energy effectively, those arrows turn in and cause harm in our inner world.\n\nAnd while none of that might seem related to the 39, all of these connections went off like a clarity bomb in my brain.\n\nIn that clarity, I could see so clearly the role that my husband has played in bringing forth my vocation.\n\nI\u2019d been married to him for just over 14 years when I wrote this post, and I already knew that he is provoking. There has always been something about him that has felt like it calls me out \u2013 even when he isn\u2019t saying a word.\n\nI think part of it is my 5\/2 profile, for sure, but with him, I have to own my shit in a way that is more subtle, under the surface, and mostly unspoken.\n\nIt has challenged me to open up, to be vulnerable, and break down walls that I didn\u2019t even know existed before I met him.\n\nAnd, as discussed inthe Gene Keys Pearl Sequence, it has absolutely unlocked so much for me in the realm of prosperity and the work I do in the world.\n\nBefore now, I had never thought of gate 39 in quite this way. It\u2019s a strong connection to vocation and what we express in the world.\n\nIt seems pretty obvious now. Gate 39 pokes the bears. And it seems only natural that the best ones to poke are the sorest spots.\n\nAnd while my husband isn\u2019t a Projector (he is a mani gen), gate 39 is a projected energy. Which means that it cuts deep. All projected energy does.\n\nAs a Projector myself, I know how important it is to wait for recognition and invitation. It is completely exhausting to try to guide someone that isn\u2019t open to it. And I\u2019ve learned not to waste my energy on someone who doesn\u2019t want to be provoked. Because if they aren\u2019t ready to wake up the bears, nothing will help them see it.\n\nAnd my M.O. is usually quite blunt and direct. I don\u2019t tend to sugar coat and I call \u2018em like I see \u2018em. The people that need that, love it. It is what they most crave. (Sound like you?Grab your map and meet me in the portal.)\n\nBut, what my husband and this contemplation has shown me is that projected energy isn\u2019t always about a grand display of ugly crying. It can also cut deep very quietly and it sneaks up on you.\n\nNo matter how it gets expressed, provocation is always directing us back to authenticity, integrity, and the most valuable contribution we can make in the world. So good to know, right?\n\n## Affirmations for Human Design Gate 39\n\nUsing your Human Design to create affirmations is a powerful way to activate the full potential of your chart.

With its proper boundaries in place, it is empowered to dedicate vast amounts of energy in service to its community.\n\nOn the \u201cnegative\u201d end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 40 is the energy for using force, rather than natural energy, to get things done \u2014 especially for others. It may believe that \u201cserving others\u201d is how one proves its worth in society and therefore, have weak or porous boundaries.

Treat yourself the way you would a small child \u2013 with love, curiosity, and understanding.\n\n### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 40 (Gene Key 40)\n\nIn the bookChants of Lifetime by Krishna Das, he starts the book by sharing the story of Neem Karoli Baba (his Guru and my Baba) sending him back to America to work through attachments.\n\nKrishna Das didn\u2019t want to go back to America; he had planned to live out the remainder of his life in India.\n\nAs he leaves the ashram, he shouts to Baba,\n\n\u201cHow can I serve you in America?\u201d\n\nBaba shouts back:\n\n\u201cIf you have to ask how to serve, it isn\u2019t service.\u201d\n\nTrue to form, this one sentence struck me like a lightning bolt (human design gate 51).\n\nWith my undefined will, undefined gate 40, and surrounded by an astounding number of people with the full 40\/37, I have held deep conditioning around being of service and worthiness.\n\nI spent most of my life trying to figure out what exactly I needed to do to be good enough and worthy of love.\n\nBut what this story, and Baba, have shown me, time and time again is that worthiness is a construct of the mind. In the eyes of the Divine, it isn\u2019t a real thing.\n\n\u201cTrue\u201d service is just a natural process for a healthy will center.\n\nBut when we \u201cserve\u201d others to prove that we are enough, good, or worthy, we only serve a limited identity of the ego.\n\nWith this awareness, I have made it a conscious practice to notice when I\u2019m giving in an attempt to be seen as good and when it is a natural expression of authenticity.\n\nWhen I am doing something for others because I believe I have to, it is exhausting. It depletes everything I have to keep that up.\n\nBut when service comes from an authentic place, it is a completely different experience for everyone. It expands rather than collapses.\n\nWhen it is authentic, rather than performative, I have this deep knowing that my next step is one of service. It is the natural state of receiving and the final stage of alchemy.\n\n(You\u2019ll learn all of the stages of alchemical transformation inside theHuman Design Mapportal.)\n\nWhen we have gone through our alchemical process and fully stepped into a \u201chigher\u201d state of consciousness, the service to others literally just pours out.\n\nWhen we are showing up for ourselves, honoring our boundaries, and expanding our consciousness, it can only work that way. You literally cannot stop that kind of flow. And there is no questioning whatsoever.\n\nAnd, while I can\u2019t know for sure, I think this is exactly what Baba was getting at in that conversation with Krishna Das.\n\nService isn\u2019t something we have to try to do. It isn\u2019t something that is expected from some mysterious bearded dude in the sky. It isn\u2019t a performance for egoic eyes.\n\nService isexpansive. It creates a ripple effect of expanded consciousness all around it.\n\nThe form doesn\u2019t matter. There is no right or wrong way.\n\nAnd when we are questioning whether or not we are doing it the right, that is a signal that we\u2019ve lost the plot. We\u2019ve become wrapped up in the story that we need to prove ourselves to be worthy of love.\n\nThose moments are not a time to double down, grit your teeth, and push through. They are moments to reconnect with yourself and to ask yourself what you would be doing if you weren\u2019t trying to prove your goodness.\n\nThe real trick is letting that be enough.\n\n## Affirmations for Human Design Gate 40\n\nUsing your Human Design to create affirmations is a powerful way to activate the full potential of your chart.

If the 41 ignores divine timing due to fear, it can feel too nervous about taking action and stoppingits dreams in itstracks.\n\nYou\u2019ll learn about the surprising (but most effective) way to raise your energy frequency in theHuman Design Map + Portal.\n\nIn the meantime, start noticing when you are feeling nervous, worried or stressed but don\u2019t be an asshole to yourself. Treat yourself the way you would a small child \u2013 with love, curiosity, and understanding.\n\n### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 41 (Gene Key 41)\n\nIn Western culture, we think of the new year January 1st.\n\nBut, in Human Design, the new year begins when the sun enters gate 41. And in the Gene Keys, gate (key) 41 is known as the \u201cstart codon,\u201d which initiates the sequencing of our literal genes.\n\nAll that to say, the energy of gate 41 is essential when it comes to new beginnings. And while I love new beginnings, gate 41 isundefinedin my chart.\n\nI\u2019ve always had a love-hate relationship with goal setting, resolutions, and making big proclamations about what I wanted to do during the year.\n\nWith my undefined root, it feels like more pressure than I can consistently regulate in a healthy way. And, with heavily defined splenic authority, making decisions and committing to what I\u2019ll be doing a year from now has yet to work.\n\nThe spleen is all about the present moment; it does not decide or commit the way the will center or sacral center do. As long as there is no immediate threat or it isn\u2019t stuck in fight or flight, the spleen doesn\u2019t really \u201ccare\u201d about the future.\n\nIntentions, on the other hand, feel much better in my body and despite a common misconception in the Human Design space intentions are not just \u201cthe mind.\u201d And as I talk about in my post onhow to make affirmations work, aligning your intentions with the truths of your Human Design is potent magick.\n\nIntentions are a key alchemical tool that arise from the depths of our G center, where the magnetic monopole (aka soul) resides. They ripple out through thenine energy centersand draw us towards our next plane of consciousness.\n\nAnd that is happening whether our mind is conscious of the intention, or not. The real magick happens when we bring our intentions into the light and start walking the path of alignment.\n\nAnother key thing to note about intentions is that, unlike goals, they are not \u201ccheck-off-able.\u201d When you set a goal \u2013 say painting the bedroom \u2013 once it is done, it is done. That isn\u2019t to say that you\u2019ll never have to paint the bedroom again but there is a finish line.\n\nIntentions don\u2019t work like that. Intentions are focused on cultivatinga vibein the present moment \u2013 no matter the circumstances. They focus on who you arebeing, the energy you bring to your life, and how aligned your everyday choices are with the truth of who you are.\n\nIntentions initiate the alchemical process, leading to the accomplishment of The Great Work (aka enlightenment), and reveal the path of alignment with each passing moment.\n\nI teach a step-by-step process for using intentions with your Human Design in theHuman Design Mapportal. If you are an existingmapclient, log into your dashboard and start at the beginning of the deconditioning toolbox.\n\nWhen you are working with your intentions, it is important to not get them mixed up with your conditioning. You want them to arise from that deeper, soulful place (of the G center) and resonate with the sound of Truth.\n\nIf they are coming from a place of needing to prove yourself, keep up with the Jones\u2019, or sacrifice yourself for the sake of others, listen deeper. Make some space for plenty ofPure Aura Timeand remember the magick of the conscious sun in yourincarnation cross.\n\n(You\u2019ll get an explanation of all four gates in your cross in yourHuman Design Map.)\n\nAnd that is where harnessing the energy of gate 41 comes in for me.\n\nGate 41 is dreamy and fantastical, and connecting withhuman design gate 30in the solar plexus, inspires a deeper relationship with how lifefeels. It helps us to tap into the desires and dreams that are hidden under the surface.\n\nSoft. Generous. And forgiving of being human.\n\nMost importantly, though, it shows us how fulfillment happens, whether we are looking at goals or intentions.\n\nEvolution happens through fulfillment. And fulfillment happens through aligned action.\n\nWhether we thrive with concrete goals or prefer more soulful intentions, we must move in the direction we want. We have to take the next aligned step, trust in the timing of life, and be open to having our deepest desires come true.\n\nSometimes, the next aligned step is going to be a nap. Or waiting. Or connecting with the people who can help you.\n\nOther times, it will be ass-in-chair, doing the work.\n\nEither way, what I\u2019ve come to understand is that beingopento fulfillment, rather than forceful, is where the most opportunity for alchemical expansion is.\n\nWhen we are under unhealthy amounts of pressure, striving, and trying to force shit, we close ourselves off from the more profound satisfaction, success, peace, and delight we seek.\n\nBut when we soften and surrender to the natural impulses of growth of evolution, fulfillment is a sure thing. Growth and evolution are a natural by-product of alignment with our deeper seeds of truth.\n\nBecause remember \u2013 the magnetic monopole (aka soul) only attracts; it cannot push things away. Much like Jupiter, it is benevolent and expansive.\n\nThere is no force required, even when doing the ass-in-chair hard work.\n\nIt is only our misaligned conditioning that keeps us small, tight, and striving for less than our full potential.\n\nOur seeds of Truth want to flourish, blossom, and express themselves. And when we open and allow, it can only be that way.\n\nIf you are ready to let go of striving and sacrificing your true desires for socially acceptable goals, you\u2019ll love theHuman Design Map + Portal.

Gate 42 believes that the future is bright with possibilities and uses that belief as fuel for bringing projects, dreams, and goals into their full potential.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 42 is the energy for unhealthy attachment, repeating the same patterns over and over again, and trying to control how things end through rebellion or self-sabotage (especially in relationships or in business).\n\nYou\u2019ll learn about the surprising (but most effective) way to raise your energy frequency in theHuman Design Map + Portal.\n\nIn the meantime, start noticing when you are feeling controlling or rebellious but don\u2019t be an asshole to yourself. Treat yourself the way you would a small child \u2013 with love, curiosity, and understanding.\n\n### My Personal Experience with Human Design (Gene Key 42)\n\nGate 42 is undefined in my chart, but I do haveHuman Design Gate 53defined (the other side of the Channel of Maturation). And, to be honest, I\u2019ve often found myself trying to solve the \u201cnever finish what I start\u201d problem.\n\nI am really good at starting things. Like, really, really good.\n\nBut finishing is a whole other story. And it has been a source of shame for my entire life.\n\nUnderstanding all of my neurodivergence has helped heal some of that. But learning more about my chart\u2014a non-sacralbeing, undefinedroot, hanging53\u2014helped me put it all in a context that made it easy to understand and practical.\n\nMy energy for finishing is meant to be inconsistent; I didn\u2019t incarnate to finish everything I start. I incarnated to gain wisdom about what it means to finish the things that are aligned and let go of the rest.\n\nBy taking off the pressure of having to finish everything I start, I was able to notice\u2014without judgment\u2014how many \u201copen loops\u201d I had in my life.\n\nSome of those loops were obvious\u2014half-finished art projects or laundry that had to be rewashed 12 times because I kept forgetting it\u2014but others were sneakier.\n\nLike the dining room table full of antique store finds I never quite got around to cleaning, finding a place for, or even unpacking. It seemed logical to just leave all of it on the table until it was \u201cprocessed.\u201d\n\nBut, as I started looking closely at the \u201cnot finishing\u201d pattern in my life, that logic started to fall apart.\n\nSee, my husband and I love to go thrifting and antique shopping. Our home d\u00e9cor has an eclectic organic modern meets mystical sigil magick vibe. I love the alchemy of taking something old and giving it a new purpose (hello,Human Design Gate 28) and old junk really works for that.\n\nBut as gate 42 worked its magick on me, I could clearly see that all of those unpacked antiques were a physical manifestation of overloading my to-do list. It was about the antiques. But it was also about more than the antiques.\n\nThe bottom line was this:\n\nI was putting way too much stuff on my to do list. I had so much \u201cto do\u201d that it would take many lifetimes to finish it all\u2014and the piles on the dining room table were just adding even more.\n\nAt first, this awareness was really depressing.\n\nI wondered if it meant that we couldn\u2019t spend our weekends wandering around our favorite shops. Or exploring new shops on our travels to seeTrevor Hallplay. Or if I\u2019d have to settle for getting mainstream decor while buying toothpaste at Target.\n\nBut even deeper than that, the conditioning of my undefinedwill centerstarted to speak.\n\nAnd suddenly, clear as day, I knew that my never-ending to-do list was a way I attempted to prove my worthiness.\n\n(Side note: If you notice the same pattern of trying to prove your worth, I\u2019ll help you unwind it in the\u200bHuman Design Map & Portal\u200b.)\n\nTo be honest, though, part of me didn\u2019t want to let go of the idea that one day I\u2019d get my shit together. That part loved the belief that one day I would do enough to earn all the gold stars. That there really was some sort of list I could check off to get the coveted worthiness award. That one day, I would stop being so broken and be able to just finish what I started.\n\nBut, a stronger part of me also knows what I tell my\u200bHuman Design Map & Portal\u200bpeople all the time:\n\nWhen you are pursuing a life of purpose, you have to take worthiness off the table of discussion. Because here\u2019s the deal:\n\nWorthiness is not a real thing. It is a made-up construct of the ego (will center). And really getting that is an essential part of deconditioning, even if your will center is defined.\n\nWhen I let go of the idea that I needed to earn worthiness, I developed more discernment about how much I could take on in any given moment.\n\nThat\u2019s when I started making different choices\u2014even with the beloved piles of antiques. I started a new experiment:\n\nIf the last trip\u2019s stuff isn\u2019t processed, we don\u2019t go on another trip. \ud83d\ude31\n\nI experimented in other ways, too. I stopped saying yes to every single thing that came my way. I learned the difference betweenattention and recognition. I questioned where the energy to start was coming from.\n\nWas it a true point of alchemy in my life (Gate 53)?\n\nWas it aligned with my purpose, calling, wisdom, and authority?\n\nOr was it just another attempt to meet the rules of what I thought I needed to prove that day?\n\nWith practice, my \u201cplate\u201d started to get clearer and clearer; I became more and more discerning about what was mine to start and finish, and what wasn\u2019t. Eventually, I noticed that there was more room in my life to just breathe and be. We even got rid of the dining room table all together.\n\nThis experiment ultimately led to a deeper sense of self-compassion. And things look different now.\n\nWe buy way less. And I\u2019m more intentional about my mindset going into a thrift or antique store. My to do list is more refined and focused. I keep my big projects to a minimum and aim to focus on the ones that serve my people better, either onmy website, onsubstack, or in the\u200bHuman Design Map & Portal\u200b.\n\nI\u2019m definitely not done \u201cbecoming wise\u201d in finishing things. And for sure, some random antique that has no place in my home will eventually find its way to me. And I\u2019ll become even wiser.\n\nBut, even when it does, I\u2019m not going to be an asshole to myself about any of it. I understand thatworthiness is an optional storythat has nothing to do with my true purpose in this world.\n\nWhat really matters is being honest with myself and trusting the process as I learn more about the delicate balance between starting and finishing.\n\nIf you\u2019re feeling called to explore how old patterns are playing out in your life, the\u200bHuman Design Map & Portal\u200bis here to guide you.

It is like a radio tuned into ideas that create breakthroughs and making space for radical transformation to occur.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 43 is the energy for listening to others instead of listening to your own inner wisdom. This clouds your ability to hear your inner truth and can cause worry, doubt, or confusion.\n\nYou\u2019ll learn about the surprising (but most effective) way to raise your energy frequency in theHuman Design Map + Portal.\n\nIn the meantime, start noticing when you are feeling worried, illogical or rebellious but don\u2019t be an asshole to yourself. Treat yourself the way you would a small child \u2013 with love, curiosity, and understanding.\n\n### My Personal Experience with Human Design Gate 43 (Gene Key 43)\n\nGate 43 isdefinedin my conscious Venus placement. Which indicates that I highly value, and see the beauty in, listening to my own inner wisdom, rather than relying on others to guide me.\n\nAND, because I am a human being who was raised in the era of tribal empowerment and \u201cfamily values\u201d (1615 \u2013 2026) over individual empowerment and the honoring of inner spirit (2027 \u2013 2438), like almost everyone walking on this planet, I was deeply conditioned to ignore my inner wisdom.\n\nI was taught most of my life that my inner wisdom was wrong, sinful, and too much for the people around me. What I wanted to do with my life was never on the table of discussion. And I was encouraged to ignore the inklings, the moments of insight, and the ring of truth in my own voice.\n\nI know that I am not alone in that.\n\nIt is why we are seeing such an increase in people who are interested in systems likeHuman Design, Astrology, the Enneagram, Meyers Briggs, and all the other systems that help people understand themselves better.\n\nWe have been taught our entire lives that all power resides outside of ourselves and that the most important thing is to keep other people \u2013 especially those in authority \u2013 happy.\n\nSo, it makes complete sense that we don\u2019t know how to listen to our own inner wisdom! Literally, how could it be any other way. Almost no one on this planet has been taught to go within to find their inner compass. And that is why we see so many people who are stuck in some flavor of theirnot-self themes.With each choice to ignore your inner wisdom and do what other people think you should, you drill into your subconscious that you are not enough, that the power resides outside of you, and that you are unworthy of a life of satisfaction, success, peace, and delight.\n\nWhen you allow your life to be run by toxic religious beliefs, new-age superstition, and\/or patriarchal systems of control,\u00a0 you perpetuate the story that your inner wisdom means nothing.\n\nAnd there is only one way out:going within, listening to your inner voice, and doing the healing work it takes to make the leap towards your north star.\n\nThe time when we can blame the world around us for our sufferings is quickly passing. It is time to find your internal source of power and use it.\n\nThat is exactly what you\u2019ll learn how to do inside theHuman Design Map + Portal.\n\nIn the meantime, the first step is to create time and space to actually hear the sound of your inner wisdom ring through you like a bell. And that means time and space that is completely free from the influence of other people\u2019s thoughts, ideas, and insights. I call this \u201cpure aura time\u201d and it is one of the first steps I recommend to all of my map clients.\n\nIn essence, pure aura time is you spending time alone, no podcasts, books, music, no work, no social media scrolling, nothing but you, yourself, and you.\n\nNow, that doesn\u2019t mean you need to be precious about it. Your pure aura time does not need to be bubble baths on mountain tops with Unicorns frolicing in fields of rainbows and butterflies.\n\nIt can be as simple as driving to work, doing the dishes, or going on a walk \u2013 minus the earbuds. It can be taking an extra three minutes on your pee break at work and just breathing. It can be a tiny moment of placing your hand on your heart and tuning into what is really going on with you.\n\nIn order to thrive, you need it.\n\nAnd listen, I don\u2019t use the word \u201cneed\u201d lightly.\n\nI am a rebel at heart. When you tell me there is something I need to do, I can assure you that me and my neurodivergent brain will find a way out.\n\nBut this is an area that it matters.\n\nNow is the time to make space to hear the sound of your own inner voice. To free your nervous system from the pressure of others\u2019 opinions, to listen to your heart, and to work through the baggage that keeps you from making choices that are aligned with what you hear.\u00a0Stop giving your power away.\n\nMake the space.\n\nGo within.\n\nListen to your inner wisdom.\n\nTrust what you hear.\n\nIf you\u2019d like some help along the way, get yourmapand go on the journey inside themapportal.\n\n## Affirmations for Human Design Gate 43\n\nUsing your Human Design to create affirmations is a powerful way to activate the full potential of your chart.

This internal resistance to the mistakes of the past actually prevents the ability to transform, learn, and grow.\n\nYou\u2019ll learn about the surprising (but most effective) way to raise your energy frequency in theHuman Design Map + Portal.\n\nIn the meantime, start noticing when you are feeling rash, hasty or untrustworthy but don\u2019t be an asshole to yourself. Treat yourself the way you would a small child \u2013 with love, curiosity, and understanding.\n\n### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 44 (Gene Key 44)\n\nGate 44 is defined in my Unconscious North Node.\n\n## Before diving in, let me give you a bit of context by sharing how I interpret some of the mechanics here\u2026\n\n### Conscious and Unconscious\n\nThe conscious side of the chart \u2013 sometimes referred to as the personality or the mind \u2013 is on the right side of the chart. Traditionally, definition on the conscious side is colored in black and reveals who we believe ourselves to be and the primary places where our consciousness is expanding.\n\nThe unconscious side of the chart \u2013 sometimes called the body or design \u2013 is on the left side of the chart. Traditionally, definition on the unconscious side is colored in red and reveals the primary \u201cshadows\u201d that \u201cblock\u201d the full expansion of the gates on the conscious side.\n\nBy healing and integrating the wisdom of the unconscious side, you automatically expand your capacity for fuller expression of the gates on the conscious side of the chart.\n\n### North and South Nodes with a little Conscious Sun thrown in for good measure\n\nThe nodes are like petri dishes for observing the growth and expansion of theincarnation cross.\n\nAnd because the conscious sun makes up 70% of the energy in the chart, it is the gate where you will see the most growth. Everything else in the chart is in service to that growth.\n\n(I cover the details of your incarnation cross inside theHuman Design Map.)\n\nBefore your Uranus Opposition (around age 42), your \u201cpetri dish\u201d is the gate in your south node and after, it is the gate in your north node.\n\n### Using the mechanics of my chart as an example, here is what that looks like.\n\nMy cross:LAX of the Clarion 2 (57\/51, 62\/61)\n\nMy Conscious Sun:Gate 57\u2013 The most important gate in my chart and cross.\n\nMy Conscious North Node:Gate 28 \u2013 Since my Uranus Opposition has already passed, this is my \u201cpetri dish.\u201d\n\nMy Unconscious North Node:Gate 44 \u2013 And this is the \u201cblock\u201d to full expansion and expression ofgate 28.\n\nThe highest expression of gate 57 is intuitive clarity and the lowest expression is the discomfort that signals that intuition is being ignored.(I\u2019ll cover the high and low expressions of your incarnation cross inside theHuman Design Map.)\n\nAnd my conscious north node isgate 28, which is all about our fear of death, taking risks, and deriving purpose from the darkness of life.\n\nSo, for me, that means that taking risks and intentionally creating purpose out of the dark stuff of life (28) will grow my capacity to trust my intuition (57).\n\nAnd in order to do that, I will need to heal my relationship with the past and the mistakes that I\u2019ve made along the way (gate 44).\n\n## Back to gate 44\u2026\n\nAnd, well, that is exactly how it has played out for me.\n\nAs I have gotten older, I\u2019ve done a lot of reflecting on my past and forgiving myself for so many of the mistakes that I\u2019ve made. As I\u2019ve turned the past into wisdom, creating purpose and meaning is much easier for me. It is like the \u201cdarkness\u201d of what has been becomes fuel for\n\nFor much of my life, I made almost everything in life mean that life was meaningless and that I had no purpose.\n\nWith gate 28 in my chart four times, I am no stranger to the darkness of life and turning that into purpose has been a relentless quest. I\u2019ve often used my past as a weapon against myself and as proof that something is wrong with me.\n\nTrue to gate 24 in my unconscious south node, I have also been someone who ruminates in the past and have had paralyzing fears of repeating the same mistakes.\n\nNow, I am seeing more clearly that mistakes really are just a part of life and that the past only has the meaning we give it. And, even more profoundly, there is actually no reason to revisit the past if it isn\u2019t for the specific purposes of moving forward. What really matters is now and how we are using the energy that is available to us.\n\nAnd in the cases where revisiting the past is helpful, it must be done with compassion (human design gate 36), forgiveness (human design gate 4), and Grace (human design gate 22).\n\nThese days, I am catching myself when I am falling into old patterns of using my past mistakes against myself. I am cultivating the mindset that everything is happening for my awakening (human design gate 51) and that right now is what matters most. I am using the healing process I teach inside theHuman Design Mapportal.\n\nAnd, most importantly, I am remembering that I am a fallible human being and that is OK.\n\nNow is the only moment that matters.

Treat yourself the way you would a small child \u2013 with love, curiosity, and understanding.\n\n### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 45 (Gene Key 45)\n\nI\u2019ve shared that I haveGate 54(not a typo!) in my mid-heaven (note: mid-heaven does not create definition in Human Design). Taken at face value, myGate 54mid-heaven means that embodying prosperity as a spiritual path is a significant part of the legacy I will leave.\n\nAnd, while I can\u2019t know what my legacy will be, I do know thatGate 54has been an important mirror for me. I\u2019ve come a long way in my money story (and bottom line!), and letting go of the belief that \u201cmoney isn\u2019t spiritual\u201d has been a key part of that. As part of that letting go, I\u2019ve had to confront my relationship with Gate 45 directly.\n\nGate 45 is undefined in my chart. And it\u2019s fair to say that I\u2019ve learned the hard way about managing money and resources. I\u2019m definitely gathering wisdom. ;)\n\nOnly recently did I heal the story that I was irresponsible with money.\n\nBy looking at my money management situations and habits with clear-eyed compassion, I\u2019ve come to understand that I am a wise steward of money. At this point, I would even go so far as to say that I am smart with money. Of course, I am not perfect\u2014of course\u2014but I\u2019m not irresponsible, clueless, or powerless in handling money.\n\nEssentially, I put my money where my mouth is by using my money for the things that align with my values.\n\nI invest in myself, my dreams, and what matters to me. I donate to causes I care about every month, and I show recognition by paying people for their work. I pay all of the\u200bMAP\u200b Team members fairly, and I\u2019m the main breadwinner in my house.\n\nI can even go to Target without buying a thing I don\u2019t need and will walk out empty handed if they don\u2019t have what I went for. The profit margins in my business are no longer an afterthought, and I don\u2019t go into debt without deep consideration of the consequences.\n\nSome of that amazes me to be able to say. It makes me feel proud of how far I\u2019ve come.\n\nBut it hasn\u2019t always been that way.\n\nFor decades, I believed the patriarchal lie that, as a woman, I am irresponsible with money.\n\nI internalized the message that I could not be trusted with money, that I was incapable of understanding how money works, and that managing money was better left to the men in my life.\n\nI had buckets of \u201cevidence\u201d that those stories were true, too. After all, believing is seeing. (not a typo, again!)\n\nWhen I was 18 years old, one of my brothers \u2014 may he rest in power \u2014 wrecked my car, and getting it fixed was not an option. I was working a part-time minimum-wage job and couch surfing. And I knewnothingabout how moneyactuallyworks.\n\nI was raised under the guise of scarcity and an assumption that I\u2019d never amount to much (financially or otherwise).\n\nMy education about money came down to this:\n\n- Get a job. Any job. It didn\u2019t matter how much I liked it.\n\n- Work really fucking hard for the rest of my life. Retirement wasn\u2019t for people like us.\n\n- Pray that robbing Peter to pay Paul wouldn\u2019t be my fate.\n\nI was also taught that rich people are terrible and that money is the root of all evil.\n\nWhen the car was wrecked beyond repair, and despite my financial situation, my parents to buy a new one \u201con credit.\u201d\n\nI did not know what \u201con credit\u201d meant or that, because of my financial situation, I setting myself up for failure. I did not understand that this decision was setting me up for decades of \u201cbad credit\u201d and shame. And I didn\u2019t know that the salesman telling me I could get a \u201ccosigner\u201d was a clue that I wasn\u2019t ready to take on the loan.\n\nI was told that this was just the way it was.\n\nAnd it turned into a dumpster fire.\n\nI could not make the payments, and in less than a year, I was being chased by the repo man.\n\nI didn\u2019t know that I should let the cosigner know so they could make the payment. And even if I had known, I would have been too ashamed to tell them. I\u2019m not even sure I understood they could take the car away.\n\nOnce I realized what was happening, I tried to hide the car. For my job, I\u2019d park in crazy places and walk really far, and since I was couch surfing, there was no reliable place to find me \u201cat home.\u201d\n\nBut, after about a week, the repo man finally caught up with me.\n\nI \u201cruined\u201d my credit and my cosigner\u2019s credit.\n\nMore importantly, my cosigner couldn\u2019t understand why I never came to them when I knew I couldn\u2019t pay.\n\nSo, not only did my choice financially haunt me (and them) for years to come, but it also drove a wedge in a deeply valued relationship, too.\n\nFrom then on, the evidence of my financial irresponsibility only grew. The shame lasted for decades after the repossession fell off my credit report; it seemed obvious that I was too fucked up to handle money wisely.\n\nAnd, in all honesty, it didn\u2019t matter much, anyway. For most of my twenties, I was broke, on drugs, binge drinking, and avoiding life altogether.\n\nEven after I got completely sober, cleaned up my life, and started my business, I was in extreme cycles of not enough having enough money and, when I did have some, spending it on shit that didn\u2019t matter.\n\nThe tables started to run when my income dramatically increased in a short period of time.(Shout out to recognizing myself, calling myself out, and owning the value of my innate gifts with the\u200bHuman Design Map\u200b!)\n\nSomething one of my mentors said many years ago started to come into focus. She said something like:\n\n\u201cPeople say that money won\u2019t buy happiness. But having money does solve a lot of problems.\n\nAnd when you solve your money problems, and you no longer feel afraid or worried about money, you can use all that energy to make an even bigger contribution to the world.\n\nWhen you have plenty of money, you can easily distribute it to the people who really need it without harming yourself. \u201c\n\nTalk about gate 45 vibes! And it truly changed my life.\n\nHaving, making, and being a steward of money is a privilege.\n\nTo be clear, I don\u2019t say that as a moral judgment or to say that you don\u2019t \u201chave it hard\u201d in other ways. But only to acknowledge that when you have money, there are things you don\u2019thave to think aboutor consider to live your daily life. You get to use that energy for other things, whereas others have to focus solely on where money will come from to survive.\n\nWhen you have plenty of money, you don\u2019t have to worry about how the mortgage will get paid. Or how food will end up on the table, the price of eggs, or what store has this or that on sale. You don\u2019t have to decide between putting gas in your car or giving your kid lunch money.\n\nAll of that energy can be channeled into other things.\n\nI did not have the privilege of money for most of my life. My family was dirt poor when I was growing up, and most of my adulthood was spent deciding what would get paid and what wouldn\u2019t.\n\nSo, when I started making more money, my eyes were opened to how irresponsible I believed I was. And I started to recognize that the way we manage money has two parts:\n\n- Our values. When we don\u2019t know our values (aka the things that matter to us) we will spend our money based on other people\u2019s values, thoughts, and opinions.\n\n- Owning the value we bring to the world. When we don\u2019t embody the value wenaturallybring to the world, we will have shitty boundaries, give until it bleeds, and under-earn.\n\nWhen we clean those two things up, money and how we manage it completely transform into abundance and generosity. That is what it means to be a good steward of money and what my mentor said all those years ago.\n\nNow, I see that I am actually really good at putting my money where my mouth is. And because I practice what I preach inside the\u200bMAP portal\u200b, I\u2019m also getting better and better at owning the value I have to share with others.\n\nAnd what I know for sure is that money is a mirror, and a mirror must be polished often.\n\nI can trust myself with money.\n\nI can decide what \u201cbeing responsible\u201d with money looks like and how important that is to me.\n\nI AM a wise steward of money.\n\nI love circulating money.\n\nI use money to make a more authentic contribution.\n\nI invest in my values.\n\nI own the value I bring to the world.\n\nWhen I catch myself thinking that I am irresponsible with money, I remind myself of these things. These new ways of thinking are my self-concept now, and I look forward to more and more wisdom about handling money.\n\nI am not irresponsible with money. I am a powerful channel for the flow of abundance and generosity.\n\nSpeaking of owning the value I bring to the world, you\u2019ll love the\u200bHuman Design Map\u200bif you want to step into a self-concept that aligns with your design, make authentic decisions, and let go of people-pleasing.\u200bGet yours here\u200b.\n\n## Affirmations for Human Design Gate 45\n\nUsing your Human Design to create affirmations is a powerful way to activate the full potential of your chart. Here are some affirmations for Gate 45:\n\nI easily manage material resources.\n\nWhen everyone\u2019s needs are met \u2013 including my own \u2013 the whole kingdom thrives.\n\nThe mundane and the spiritual are one and the same.\n\nInside yourHuman Design Map, you\u2019ll get a full list of empowering beliefs for your type + strategy, authority, profile, and all four gates of yourincarnation crossand show you how to go from affirmation to full-on embodiment.

Treat yourself the way you would a small child \u2013 with love, curiosity, and understanding.\n\n### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 46 (Gene Key 46)\n\nGate 46.6 is defined in my conscious mercury. I interpret that to mean that I am here to communicate the wisdom of embodiment.\n\n(BTW, if you are aHuman Design Mapclient and a business owner, I talk about the relevance of mercury in the context of business inside the portal.)\n\nI also have a defined head with channel61\/24(called the channel of awareness), which means that I am no stranger to esoteric knowledge, mysticism, (61) and grounding that with reason (24).\n\nAnd something I have gotten on my 5th line soap box about a bazillion times is that spiritual knowledge means nothing if it isn\u2019t embodied.\n\nAs the cliche goes, we aren\u2019t human beings having a spiritual experience, we are spiritual beings having a human experience.\n\nTrue to my 46 being in the 6th line, though, it has taken me some time to really see how that plays out in my own life.\n\nI haven\u2019t exactly been a perfect model of being present and reveling in my body. In fact, in my 20\u2019s, I was a drug addict, binge drinker\/eater, and smoker. I also repeatedly energetically left my body during times of trauma.\n\nI\u2019ve also experienced chronic illness and pain for most of my adult life; I\u2019ve been bed-bound more than once and occasionally have to walk with a cane.\n\nIn the past 15+ years, I\u2019ve done a lot of healing work around my relationship with food, drugs, and alcohol. I\u2019ve been completely sober and a non-smoker for about that time and haven\u2019t binged in over a decade.\n\nAnd what that healing has shown me, loud and clear, is that the purpose of life is to be presentin the body.\u00a0 With all the intense feelings and sensations that life brings. Including the ones that hurt like hell.\n\nWe aren\u2019t here totranscendthe human experience. We aren\u2019t here to rise above. Or try to \u201cbe spiritual.\u201d\n\nIt isn\u2019t that we can\u2019t have transcendent experiences or that connecting with a \u201chigher\u201d perspective isn\u2019t useful. But when we try tobethat, instead of what we are, we create suffering.\n\nAs Ram Dass would say, Be Here Now.\n\nI think that is why I am so passionate about the message that knowing your Human Design means nothing if you don\u2019t actually experiment and integrate what you discover. It\u2019s why theHuman Design Map + Portalis abundant with resources to help you both learn AND embody.\n\nEmbodiment is where the magic happens! Every single time.\n\nWith each method of escape that I\u2019ve let go of, that knowing only gets stronger and stronger.\u00a0 And not just about Human Design \u2013 about everything.\n\nLife really is happeningin the body.\n\nI\u2019m no longer blind to my urges to escape my body. I can see them clearly.\n\nAnd when I am present with those urges, I know how to show up for myself. It\u2019s a capacity that I have built over time. It didn\u2019t happen overnight.\n\n(I teach the \u201chow\u201d of that in theHuman Design Map)\n\nAs my capacity for being present in my body has grown, so has my success, my authenticity, my expression, my intuition, and my contribution. The body is where all of that wisdom lives.\n\nMost recently, I\u2019m focusing on being with physical pain and symptoms. To let them be instead of trying to fix them. Do what I can and let the rest be what it is.\n\nTo be fully human, it only works that way.\n\nBut if you are like me and you\u2019ve experienced a metric fuck ton of trauma and escaping your body has been your only hope at survival, you can\u2019t expect to just stop it all overnight. You just have to have compassion (human design gate 36), forgiveness (human design gate 4), and give yourself heaps and heaps of grace (human design gate 22).\n\nIt takes time to become present in your body.\n\nBut when you do, magic really does await because your body holds the wisdom.\n\n## Affirmations for Human Design Gate 46\n\nUsing your Human Design to create affirmations is a powerful way to activate the full potential of your chart. Here are some affirmations for Gate 46:\n\nSynchronicity is my north star.\n\nI love being in a human body.\n\nI revel in all that life offers me.\n\nInside yourHuman Design Map, you\u2019ll get a full list of empowering beliefs for your type + strategy, authority, profile, and all four gates of yourincarnation crossand show you how to go from affirmation to full-on embodiment.

Treat yourself the way you would a small child \u2013 with love, curiosity, and understanding.\n\n### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 47 (Gene Key 47)\n\nIn my early thirties, I heard two axioms that changed the trajectory of my life\u2026\n\nYour thoughts create your reality.\n\nAND\n\nYou are not your thoughts.\n\nWith my defined head and ajna, these ideas were nothing short of a holy revelation; they were indeed an a-ha moment.\n\nFor most of my life, I was very identified with my thoughts. I didn\u2019t understand the sentences, stories, and conclusions inside my head were more like leaves on my river rather than being the river itself. And I had no idea that I had any sort of power over my thinking, either.\n\nAnd true to mytranspersonal karma, learning that my thoughts and interpretations were \u201cchoices\u201d set me onto a whole new path. And it is something that I will be forever grateful for.\n\nThe revelation of free-will is nothing short of miraculous.\n\nBut, I quickly learned that, in practice, there is a little more to it than \u201cchange\u00a0 your thoughts to change your life.\u201d\n\nAs with any axiom, cliche, or widely accepted piece of \u201cwisdom\u201d there is always a kernel of \u201ctruth.\u201d But truth is subjective. And when we turn cliches into objective reality, and ignore the need for context, nuance, and empathy, things can quickly go south.\n\nWithout comprehension, on a very human level, axioms become impossible standards and measuring sticks of worthiness. They go from being empowering tools to being weapons that we use against ourselves and others.\n\nThat is exactly what happened to me when I sunk all of my energy into believing that my thoughts create my reality.\n\nYes, there was some truth for me there. But mostly, it was an inner war that I could never win. I commonly gaslighted myself (and probably others) into believing that things were great when they absolutely were not. I started to hate myself for having certain thoughts and I perpetuated the very same traumatic patterns that I was trying to heal.\n\nI became insatiable on the quest for the rush of dopamine that came with the newest a-ha moment. A shift in a single thought could put me on a high for days.\n\nAnd then, the inevitable crash.\n\nBecause I am human, my thoughts would seemingly \u201cchange back\u201d and I\u2019d be back to square one. But this time, with an all new layer of shame because \u201cI knew better,\u201d\n\nIn hindsight, and with my awareness of my Human Design, I can see a few things playing out here.\n\nFirst, with my undefined solar plexus, I think I was actually unconsciously amplifying the emotional wave of people who had also become obsessed with \u201cthought work.\u201d\n\nProbably more importantly, I was using those tools as a way to keep up in a neurotypical Generator world. I\u2019d \u201cchange my thoughts\u201d about feeling exhausted and I\u2019d force myself to do things that I thought I \u201cshould\u201d do.\n\nThankfully, by the mystery of Grace (human design gate 22), I started to recognize that changing my thoughts as a way of bypassing my emotions, glossing over trauma imprints, and ignoring my inner wisdom was causing way more harm than good.\n\nAnd that by making space to just be with myself and trusting the alchemical process (which I teach inside theHuman Design Map), the a-ha moment really does always just come when we give it space.\n\nBy leaning into our inner wisdom and making space to energetically breathe, our perspective naturally changes.

Gate 48 understands that you don\u2019t become wise through education. You become wise through embodiment. With this understanding, it is empowered to explore the depths of life with curiosity and humility.\n\nOn the \u201cnegative\u201d end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 48 is the energy for pursuing knowledge and education as a way to buffer from emotions. It can lead to over-preparing, overplanning, and feeling inadequate in what you know. At its worst, it can abuse positions of power where others are looking to you for depth of wisdom.\n\nYou\u2019ll learn about the surprising (but most effective) way to raise your energy frequency in theHuman Design Map + Portal.\n\nIn the meantime, start noticing when you are feeling like a book worm or avoidant but don\u2019t be an asshole to yourself. Treat yourself the way you would a small child \u2013 with love, curiosity, and understanding.\n\n### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 48 (Gene Key 48)\n\nAs I mentioned in my post abouthuman design gate 18, Gate 48 is defined in my conscious Pluto, which is conjunct with my conscious sun (human design gate 57).\n\nI actually have the full channel of the wavelength (48-16) because gate 16 is defined in my conscious moon.\n\n(I deep dive on all 36 channels inside theHuman Design Mapportal.)\n\n## But before I get too deep on my experience with gate 48, let\u2019s talk about general mechanics and how I interpret them\u2026\n\n### Pluto, Conscious Sun, Conjunction\n\nPluto is the place where we go through repeated rebirth in our lives \u2013 a place where our ego will die, again and again. Pluto takes us into the deepest shadows of our psyche and brings us out the other side with a new sense of integrity and wholeness.\n\nIn astrology, a conjunction is when two placements are in the same sign. There is some debate about how many degrees create a true conjunction \u2013 the most rigid definition being 10\u00b0.\n\nWhen Pluto is conjunct with the sun, it brings a whole new level of intensity to the (astrology) chart because it \u201cblends\u201d with the life\u2019s work of the conscious sun.\n\nBecause of the size of the sun and the density of its neutrino, the conscious sun is 70% of our energy.Everythinghappening in the chart is in service to the full expression of the conscious sun.\n\nAnd conjunct Pluto, one would expect the full expression of their sun to include lots of (ego) death and rebirth. Pluto people, as they are often called, are alchemists to the core.\n\n### Defined Channels\n\nDefined channels are when both gates of a channel are defined.\n\nWhen a channel is defined, we tend to have an easier time balancing the energies on each side of the channel and embody afuller spectrumfor them.\n\nThey correspond to the pathways in the Kabbalah Tree of Life.\n\n### Kabbalah and Human Design\n\nKabbalah, Qabalah, and Cabalah are all based on the Tree of Life and I use them interchangeably to honor the various paths.\n\nKabbalah is the original system from the Jewish tradition, Qabalah is the Western Esoteric (aka Hermetic) path often called Ceremonial Magick or High Magick, and the Cabbala is a christian mystic path. Both Qabalah and Cabbala are rooted in Kabbalah.\n\nAll of these are spiritual paths that lead to what is called Enlightenment, Moksha, Self-Realization, a United Will, Completing The Great Work, Oneness, I AM Consciousness, Crystalline Consciousness, Christ Consciousness, and likely many others that I am either forgetting or just not aware of.\n\nKabbalah is one of the main systems that Human Design pulls from. In particular, there is correspondence between the 36 channels of the HD chart and the 32 pathways in the Tree of Life.\n\nWhich, I interpret that to mean that when we surrender to the voice of our magnetic monopole, we too are on the same path to enlightenment.\n\n## Back to my gate 48\u2026\n\nMy conscious sun (57), conjunct my conscious Pluto (48), and having the full 48-16 defined has been an interesting thing for me to contemplate. Particularly when I consider my experience of both learning and teaching\n\nOther than the High Magick (which \u201cworks\u201d the Kabbalah Tree of Life) and Alchemical Magick, Human Design is the only system that has held my interest enough to go really deep.\n\nAnd, quite honestly, had it not been for my study of High Magick and Alchemy, I don\u2019t think Human Design would have captured my heart the way it has.\n\nIn fact, I heard of Human Design about a decade before I looked more deeply into it. At that time in my life, I didn\u2019t quite understand the value of \u201cwaiting\u201d for anything.\n\nBut, after years of studing energy healing, magick, and Qabalah + a metric fuck ton of magickal synchronicities, I found my way back to Human Design.\n\nThe connection between the flow of the bodygraph and the Kabbalah (Qabalah) Tree of Life hit me like a lightning bolt. I saw the Human Design Chart in a whole new way.\n\nBecause of my understanding of the 32 paths of Qabalah, I thought, yep, that is how energy flows in the energy body.\n\nAs I started to study Human Design, I saw how truly practical it is when it is broken down into understandable parts. It was like it made Kabbalistic pathworking more \u201cworkable.\u201d\u00a0 And perspective has flowed into how I approach theHuman Design Map, too.\n\nTrue to my pluto (48) conjunct sun (57), as I\u2019ve gotten deeper and deeper into the Qabalah and Human Design, I\u2019ve been able to step more into trusting my intuition and having many rebirths regarding my natural depth.\n\nI long had a story that I was \u201ctoo deep.\u201d Making friends was a lifelong challenge because most people think I am \u201ctoo intense.\u201d\n\nI often joke that if we aren\u2019t talking about God within 5 minutes of meeting, we cannot be friends.\n\nWith Human Design in particular, I most recently realized that I had been holding back my depth of knowledge. I bought into the story that what I put out into the world needed to be easy to consume and that I needed to turn the dial down on my firehose.\n\nBut, of course, it is actually my depth that the people I am here to serve actually love. They don\u2019t want me to hold back and stay on the surface. They want me to take it out as far into the ether as possible. And, of course, bring it back down for some practical know-how, when necessary.\n\nWhether it is the conversations that happen inside themapportal or the deep dive series on my blog, it is the very thing that people love so much.\n\nIt is kind of funny now. I mean, seriously, Human Design is deep as fuck. I truly believe you could spend lifetimes studying it and experimenting with it and still only scratching the surface.\n\nI\u2019m not sure why I thought I needed to hold back. Human Design is the perfect place to \u201cchannel\u201d that 48-16 energy.\n\nDuh.\n\n## Affirmations for Human Design Gate 48\n\nUsing your Human Design to create affirmations is a powerful way to activate the full potential of your chart.

Gate 49 deeply understands thatflowis the natural state of all energy \u2013 especially emotional energy \u2013 energy is meant to move at the right timing. The 49 has an emotional sense of when it\u2019s time for a change, a renewal, and even a revolution.\n\nOn the \u201cnegative\u201d end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 49 is the energy for believing that there is a right way and a wrong way to do life. Thiscausesthe 49 to become rigid and\u00a0 \u201csettle for nothing less\u201d than perfect. From this place, it is common for the 49 to ruthlessly cut people out of their lives when they don\u2019t live up to their perfect standards.\n\nYou\u2019ll learn about the surprising (but most effective) way to raise your energy frequency in theHuman Design Map + Portal.\n\nIn the meantime, start noticing when you are feeling ignorant, rebellious or intolerant, but don\u2019t be an asshole to yourself. Treat yourself the way you would a small child \u2013 with love, curiosity, and understanding.\n\n### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 49 (Gene Key 49)\n\nGate 49 (line 5) is in my unconscious moon, and\u2026it\u2019s been a journey. ;)\n\nOur moon placements reveal how we relate to ourselves, our emotions, our intuition, and our inner wisdom.\n\nThe unconscious (red) side of the chart is symbolic of the parts of ourselves that we become conscious of over the course of our life. And often, they are the parts that we hide, reject, or banish in an attempt to be accepted by others (akashadow parts).\n\nBesides the metric fuck ton of energy it takes to keep these parts of ourselves hidden (from ourselves), our shadows are actually the energies we need to leverage in order to have a full expression on the conscious (black) side of the chart.\n\nIn other words, if we maintain a \u201clow\u201d frequency on the unconscious side, the same will be true on the conscious side.\n\nAnd despite what you\u2019ve been told about your shadows, the answer isn\u2019t to get rid of those parts; it is to love, value, and embrace them as essential parts of your higher purpose.\n\nThis is precisely what I\u2019ve been doing with gate 49 in my unconscious moon.\n\n(I\u2019ll teach you \u201chow\u201d to love, value, and embrace your shadows inside the Human Design Map Portal.)\n\nSome of the shadow words that could describe gate 49 are stubborn, intolerant, and rebellious. It is often referred to as \u201cthe murderer\u201d or \u201cthe butcher\u201d because it has a sharp knife and isn\u2019t afraid to use it.\n\nBy doing my own shadow integration work, I have no shame in saying that I\u2019ve been known to cut people out of my life due to my intolerance of their so-called imperfections. And I\u2019ve ruthlessly burned bridges more times than I can count.\n\nAbout a decade ago, I even concluded that my \u201ctoxic trait\u201d was running when relationships got hard. It became a weapon I used against myself and a way to stay stuck in my \u201cnot good enough\u201d story.\n\nSomewhere along the way, I was conditioned to believe that a \u201ctruly healed person\u201d would stay, no matter what. And with every relationship I ended, I hated myself more and more.\n\nI thought that to grow and be an \u201cevolved\u201d person, I needed to learn how to stay, even when I was treated like hot garbage. I believed my role was to be a one-way emotional dumping ground. And that I should take it when people are utterly incapable ofowning their projections.\n\nAnd \u201cGod\u201d knows I tried. But I would inevitably reach my breaking point, and my spleen would scream a fiery NO.\n\nThings came to a head when I spontaneously ended two significant relationships in less than a year.\n\nThe first was long overdue. It had always felt tough to stand up for myself and be clear about myboundaries. But on that fated day, I knew that it was time to end things for my emotional, mental, and spiritual well-being.\n\nThe second hit harder because it happened very suddenly. It turned out that they weren\u2019t being authentic in our relationship. And hadn\u2019t been for some time. I was hard on myself about not seeing through their inauthenticity; it opened old wounds around self-trust. And I felt ashamed that it was \u201cyet another\u201d relationship I no longer wanted to be in.\n\nAs I contemplated gate 49 in my unconscious moon, though, I realized that the problem wasn\u2019t that I \u201calways ran\u201d when things got hard in a relationship.\n\nThe problem was that I was hard on myself for having boundaries, clear needs, and a spleen with no fucks left to give.\n\nAnd while that energy was often expressed through stubbornness, intolerance, and rebellion, at the end of the day, it was me standing up for myself and my principles. I\u2019m leading a personal revolution of authenticity, which can be messy AF.\n\n(Which is why I offer the tools and support I do inside theHuman Design Map & Portal!)\n\nAnd here is the key:\n\nWhen I don\u2019t\u2026\n\n\u2026stand up for myself\n\n\u2026honor my boundaries\n\n\u2026show up authentically\n\nI lose the connection I have with myself. My emotions get the best of me because I\u2019m ignoring them. My intuitive spleen must ROAR because I\u2019m not heeding the whispers.\n\nBy loving and owning this energy, my \u201crunning\u201d instinct becomes a signal that something is off in my inner world. When I want to cut a bitch, it lets me know that I have needs, values, and boundaries that need tending.\n\nWith that awareness, I can take a step back, tune in, and see what is most authentic. By doing that, stubbornness, intolerance, and rebellion transform into wisdom, discernment, and revolution.\n\nI\u2019ve let go of the idea that staying in relationships that aren\u2019t healthy is a badge of honor. Staying or going doesn\u2019t prove anything, and I\u2019ve forgiven myself for believing it does.\n\nWhat I understand now is that being honest with ourselves is what matters most. Because that is the ONLY place we can be honest with others.\n\nYou can only stand in your Truth \u2013 about your needs, values, and boundaries \u2013 if you know your Truth.\n\nThat kind of self-leadership will lead to a revolution of authenticity in our relationships.\n\nAnd I\u2019m glad to be doing my part. Even if it looks like a hot fucking mess sometimes.\n\nIf you want to join me in the revolution by becoming a master at transforming your shadows into light,that is precisely what we\u2019ll do inside the Human Design Map + Portal. I\u2019ll see you there.\n\n## Affirmations for Human Design Gate 49\n\nUsing your Human Design to create affirmations is a powerful way to activate the full potential of your chart.

Gate 50 has an instinctive knowing that groups are only as healthy as each member and can easily spot fears that \u201ccorrupt\u201d a group. With this awareness, it is able to determine the values that will serve it, the community and the collective.\n\nOn the \u201cnegative\u201d end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 50 is the energy for staying in groups even though you can sense their \u201ccorrupt\u201d nature.

I wrote about what a profound experience that was in my post ongate 15.\n\nBut, that aside, gate 50 has played a pretty significant role in my life because my conscious south node is also defined by its harmonic gate,human design gate 27.\n\nSince I have passed my Uranus Opposition, I have shifted intogate 28being my nodal \u201cpetri dish.\u201d (I explain the petri dish concept in my post ongate 48).\n\nBut, for most of my life, I have been deeply challenged in finding the balance between my needs and the needs of others.\n\nThere are lots of places in my chart that can point to that, havingtranspersonal karmabeing the main one. But, the chart aside, I think most women, especially of my age, were conditioned to sacrifice themselves for the sake of others.\n\nSo, whether it all comes down to gate 27 in my south node, I can\u2019t say for sure.\n\nWhat I can say, though, is that the thing that shifted my energy in gate 27 was knowing my values and aligning myself with them.\n\nInside theHuman Design Mapportal, I have a guide on defining your values. If you are amapclient, you can find thathere.\n\nSome of my top values are integrity, intention, and clarity. With a mix of individual and collectivecircuitry, I also value individual and collective empowerment.\n\nAnd nowhere in those values do I put myself at the bottom of the list. More importantly, I don\u2019t surround myself with people who expect that from me.\n\nI no longer believe that I was put on this earth to please others.\n\nI started surrounding myself with people who understood that you can\u2019t get water out of a dry well. I stopped being attached to what certain groups of people thought about me. And I let go of the idea that my value as a human being came from what I could do for others.\n\nI can\u2019t say that I always get the balance right. As I said before, I am a 5\/2 profile which meansmy karma is transpersonal. So, on some level, I will always be balancing my need to serve others with my need to go within and be in my own flow. And deconditioning is about practice, not perfection.\n\n(You\u2019ll learn about your profile and karma in theHuman Design Map.)\n\nBut, for the most part, I do understand that honoring my needs + values and giving from the overflow is the way to go. And, I practice letting the chips fall where they may \u2013 by letting others think whatever they want about me.\n\nAnd, I am starting to see that, as a karmic mirror for others (5\/2), doing what is best for me and in alignment with my values is a powerful mirror to hold up.\n\n## Affirmations for Human Design Gate 50\n\nUsing your Human Design to create affirmations is a powerful way to activate the full potential of your chart. Here are some affirmations for Gate 50:\n\nI live according to my values.\n\nI know which groups are healthy and which ones aren\u2019t.\n\nI harmonize groups to a higher frequency.\n\nInside yourHuman Design Map, you\u2019ll get a full list of empowering beliefs for your type + strategy, authority, profile, and all four gates of yourincarnation crossand show you how to go from affirmation to full-on embodiment.

In its highest frequency, gate 51 believes life is trustworthybecause ofit\u2019s curveballs (rather than in spite of them) and practices radical faith that every moment, even the most horrific ones, are gateways into Divine Love.\n\nOn the \u201cnegative\u201d end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 51 is the energy for using shock to hurt others, pushing people\u2019s buttons, and deeply traumatic life experiences. These are all indicators of losing faith in life\/the Divine and ignoring the calls to awaken.\n\nYou\u2019ll learn about the surprising (but most effective) way to raise your energy frequency in theHuman Design Map + Portal.\n\nIn the meantime, start noticing when you are feeling faithless, trustless or shocked but don\u2019t be an asshole to yourself. Treat yourself the way you would a small child \u2013 with love, curiosity, and understanding.\n\n### My Personal Experience with Human Design Gate 51 (Gene Key 51)\n\nI have gate 51 (line 5) in the conscious earth of myincarnation cross.\n\nAnd to say that I know the energy of Gate 51 really well would be the understatement of the century.\n\nI once had a therapist tell me that people with stories like mine jump off bridges. An astrologer told me that they\u2019d need a stiff drink to read my chart. And an \u201cIntuitive Human Design Expert\u201d told me that I should just call it quits, collect unemployment, and play video games for the rest of my life.\n\nAs a child, I witnessed things you wouldn\u2019t wish on your worst enemy. I\u2019ve experienced things no human should have to experience. And I often feel like I\u2019ve lived hundreds of lifetimes in this one incarnation.\n\nI could truly go on for days about the various shocks I\u2019ve experienced. That isn\u2019t to say that I\u2019ve had a \u201cworse\u201d life than anyone else. I don\u2019t really find those types of judgments useful.\n\nBut, I do share it to demonstrate that working WITH the energy we actually have, instead of using it against ourselves, is the greatest contribution we can make to the world.\n\nIt took me many, many years to understand that, and it is what I teach myHuman Design Mapclients every single day.\n\nFor the first part of my life, I didn\u2019t know how to deal with the shock and trauma. And, like so many in my generation, no one helped me process my experiences in a healthy way, and I was often dismissed as being \u201ctoo sensitive\u201d or \u201cdramatic.\u201d\n\nBy high school, I had developed an eating disorder, and by my mid-twenties I was strung out on drugs.\n\nThe pain was too much to bear.\n\nThat began to change during my first Saturn Return.\n\nOne of my brothers, Ronnie, died in a car accident at the age of 25. My other brother, Bryan, has since unexpectedly died as well.\n\nBoth were powerful spiritual awakenings in my life.\n\nBut when Ronnie died, the sheer shock of it cracked me open in a way that I can\u2019t explain.\n\nIt is like I finally surrendered to the beautiful disaster of life on Earth.\n\nSuddenly, I had a deep understanding that life will always be full of plot twists and that I can either keep using them against me or for me.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t have said it quite that way at the time. I\u2019m not even sure I would have seen it as such a pivotal time in my life.\n\nBut my life was never the same after it.\n\nBy my early 30s, I was in much-needed therapy, recovering from the eating disorders, completely sober, in a healthy relationship with my husband, and starting my business.\n\nIt was a winding road, of course, and I learned a metric fuck ton along the way.\n\nI went on to become a master energy healer and coach. I developed my signature energy healing method and eventually surrendered to the call to teach others about their Human Design.\n\n(I teach my signature healing method, called the MAP Method for Deconditioning, inside theHuman Design Mapportal.)\n\nAs gate 51 shows us, I let the shocks wake me up.\n\nBut, of course, awakening is an ongoing process. After we integrate one thing, a new layer is revealed, and that is precisely what happened when I was 36.\n\nI \u201caccidentally\u201d learned that the man I call dad isn\u2019t my biological father.\n\nMy parents had kept this secret from me and never intended to tell me the truth. The pain was complex and profound. I felt relieved, angry, hurt, and confused.\n\nThe way I experienced the shock was utterly different, though.\n\nIt hurt like hell, but I immediately understood it was for my awakening. I knew that I would emerge from it with a more embodied experience of Grace, forgiveness, and gratitude.\n\nTrue to my design, I was stable and grounded by the shock. I know that sounds like a paradox. But it is 100% true.\n\nIt is a paradox because we often believe that shock must equal suffering.\n\nBut, like all beliefs, seeing life that way is optional.\n\nI now realize that spiritual awakening requires shock.\n\nShock cracks our hearts wide open so that we can receive the wealth of unconditional love (gate 25).\n\nEven in our deepest suffering, even in the face of our ugliest shadows, and even when we can\u2019t wrap our minds around whatever is happening.\n\nIt is always happeningforus, nottous.\n\nAnd there is nothing more beautiful than that.\u00a0When you are ready to have your heart cracked wide open, purchase yourHuman Design Mapand then take the journey in the portal. Let it shock you.\n\n## Affirmations for Human Design Gate 51\n\nUsing your Human Design to create affirmations is a powerful way to activate the full potential of your chart. Here are some affirmations for Gate 51:\n\nI have radical faith in life.\n\nEvery experience in life is an opportunity to awaken.\n\nI have the courage to live according to my inner guidance.\n\nInside yourHuman Design Map, you\u2019ll get a full list of empowering beliefs for your type + strategy, authority, profile, and all four gates of yourincarnation crossand show you how to go from affirmation to full-on embodiment.

With this mindset, it can sit still, concentrate on the things that capture its interest, and trust in the right timing.\n\nOn the \u201cnegative\u201d end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 52 is the energy for staying still when it\u2019s time to move and moving when it\u2019s time to stay still. It can also try to force things to work according to its mind\u2019s timing rather than trusting in Divine timing, which can lead to things not working as the mind hopes.\n\nYou\u2019ll learn about the surprising (but most effective) way to raise your energy frequency in theHuman Design Map + Portal.\n\nIn the meantime, start noticing when you aren\u2019t trusting Divine Timing but don\u2019t be an asshole to yourself. Treat yourself the way you would a small child \u2013 with love, curiosity, and understanding.\n\n### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 52 (Gene Key 52)\n\nGate 52 is in the root center, a pressure center and home to the adrenal glands. The bodygraph has two pressure centers: the head and the root.\n\nSimply put, the head center creates the pressure to think by asking big questions, and the root center creates pressure to take or guide the actions that evolve humanity. The gates that are pressured to take action are Gate 52,Gate 60, andGate 53. The gates that are pressured to guide action areGate 58,Gate 38,Gate 54,Gate 19,Gate 39, andGate 41.\u200bIn traditional Human Design, the pressure of the root center is often described as a pulse; it turns on and off mysteriously \u2013 it cannot be predicted or controlled. This uncontrollable pulse is often called Divine Timing.\n\nIn the case of the 52, since it is part of a generated channel and is also a format channel, the pressure is to take action in Divine Timing. Divine timing is an essential part of how humans evolve\u2014it is literally one of the formats of the changes and transformations that humanity will go through.\n\n(If you are aHuman Design Map & Portalcustomer, you can find more information on format channels in the Channels course in your portal dashboard. My team and I would love to answer any questions you have in the discussions there.)\n\nWhile I have a defined head center, and am all too familiar with the pressure the head creates, my root center is undefined. And, without a doubt, I can say that any wisdom I have about root pressure is hard-won. True to my root being undefined, so much of my life has been about trying to escape pressure and stress by taking action.\n\nAnd, as they say, the body keeps the score. I\u2019ve completely burnt out my adrenals a couple of times and have pulled myself off the brink of it more times than I can count.\n\nOn the other hand, my husband has channel 9-52 defined, and therefore, a defined root center.\n\nAnd while it is natural and easy for me to regulate the pressure in the head, he is a true natural at the pressure of the root.\n\nHe works in a high-pressure job with constant deadlines and it takes A LOT to stress him out. If he is stressed, you know some shit is going down.\n\nWhat I\u2019ve noticed about him that is so different from me is his pace in general. His energy is very \u201csteady mountain\u201d and he rarely, if ever, rushes. He has his own inner sense of timing that seems to work for him.\n\nEven when I LOUDLY roll my eyes, he won\u2019t hurry out the door. It is like he doesn\u2019t even know how. In contrast, you will find me rushing, rushing, rushing to get to the next thing; I have to consciously slow myself down.\n\nFor example, when we go to Target, he is always many steps behind me, and it\u2019s easy for me to lose him. I speed walk like my life depends on getting to the toilet paper aisle the fastest, and he is on a leisurely Sunday stroll.\n\nIt\u2019s a constant reminder for me to slow the fuck down.\n\nI don\u2019t always have to take action right now. I don\u2019t have to rush to get toilet paper. I don\u2019t have to live every single minute like I\u2019m on a super-secret mission.\n\nI can slow down. I can trust myself, life, and that thing that some call God.\n\nLife is not as urgent as we often make it out to be. When we lean into Divine Timing, combined with our own inner wisdom, things really do have a way of working themselves.\n\nWe don\u2019t have to rush to the next thing, and we don\u2019t even have to pressure ourselves to grow and evolve.\n\nAs the bodygraph shows us, that isn\u2019t in our control, and it happens naturally as we lean into our authentic energy.\n\nThere really is an ebb and flow to this crazy experience called Life As Human. It is just a matter of choosing which game we want to play. Do we trust the Divine? Or do we try to control the flow? You choose.\n\nIf you want to trust Divine Timing and harness the power of your authentic energy, you will love theHuman Design Map & Portal. It will help you understand your design, make authentic decisions, overcome people-pleasing, and believe in the value you bring to the world.Get yours here.\n\n## Affirmations for Human Design Gate 52\n\nUsing your Human Design to create affirmations is a powerful way to activate the full potential of your chart.

It can lead to always staying in your comfort zone and quitting too soon.

Treat yourself the way you would a small child \u2013 with love, curiosity, and understanding.\n\n### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 53 (Gene Key 53)\n\nGate 53, line 6, is defined in my unconscious Mercury.\n\nI am quite obsessed with Mercury and his role in our Human Design chart.\n\nMercury, in Greek mythology, was Hermes. He was the God of travel, translation, commerce, financial gain, wealth, and communication. He loaded up his cart and brought valuable gifts to the people in the village.The distance between the conscious (personality) and unconscious (design) sides of the chart is 88\u00b0, the exact time it takes Mercury to make a complete orbit (aka all 64Human Design gates) around the sun.\n\nThis, to me, means that Mercury infused ourincarnation cross(aka purpose) with everything we could possibly need to bring our cart of highly valuable gifts to the metaphorical market.\n\nOur Mercury placement specifically tells us what we communicate to the world when we show up to be seen by others.\n\nIf you are one of myHuman Design Mapclients and have checked out the quick and dirty business guide in the portal, you already know that our Mercury isn\u2019t something we conjure or need to \u201ctry\u201d to communicate.You\u2019ve heard the adage that energy doesn\u2019t lie. Humans can sense the frequency we vibrate no matter what we say or do. That\u2019s Mercury.\n\nThe value we bring to others is the frequency of our Mercury placement. And it can\u2019t be faked.\n\nTo take this even further, if the conscious side Mercury is what we communicate (no matter what we are doing), our unconscious Mercury is the primary \u201cblock\u201d that prevents expansion into higher frequencies on the conscious side.\n\nSo, if we communicate a \u201clow vibe,\u201d a shadow on the unconscious side of the chart needs integration.\n\nTo be clear, \u201clow vibe\u201d is not a moral judgment, even though new-age rhetoric often turns it into one. That is why I put it in quotes.Every single human being on the planet is a mix of shadow (unconscious) and light (conscious). Our consciousness expands by bringing our shadows (unconscious parts) into the light (conscious awareness).\n\nIn other words, shadow integration is \u201chow\u201d we come to know our Divinity. The great spiritual masters \u2013 Jesus, Buddha, Krishna, etc. \u2013 showed us what that looks like.\n\nWhen it comes to what our lives say to the world, our unconscious Mercury gate is the primaryshadowthat \u201cblocks\u201d higher-frequency communication.\n\nFor me, that \u201cblock\u201d is gate 53, the Spark of Alchemy.\n\nI havegate 46, line 6, in my conscious mercury. This means that \u2014 no matter what I am doing \u2014 I\u00a0 communicate about the magick of synchronicity, the embodiment of bhakti, and the love of being alive in a human body.\n\nThat is probably why I strongly advocate for knowing your human design AND using it as a doorway into self-discovery, experimentation, and intentional living. It\u2019s why I offer so much follow-up support and additional resources with theHuman Design Map & Portal.\n\nI know that experimenting leads to the embodiment of the soul; it is how we can revel in being alive. And fall madly in love with who we truly are. That magick has absolutely nothing to do with information.\n\nWithout experimenting, Human Design falls 100% flat.\n\nWhen I first started sharing about Human Design though, I was holding back a lot.\n\nI came into Human Design with a background in energy healing, alchemy, High Magick, and Western Kabbalahistic pathworking.\n\nAnd I saw how others had their names dragged through the mud when they had even a tiny deviation from \u201csource material\u201d in theirinterpretation of Human Design.\n\nTrue to gate 53 in my unconscious Mercury, integrating magick and alchemy into my work with Human Design felt terrifying.\n\nBut as I worked through my fears and brought those parts to the metaphorical village, I could see that magick, alchemy, and understanding how transformation actually works are essential for me to communicate about embodiment.\n\nIt isn\u2019t optional. It is what draws people to me.\n\nAnd I don\u2019t just mean to teach it. I do. The entireMAPMethod for Deconditioning inside theHuman Design Map & Portalis based on the seven phases of spiritual alchemy.\n\nI mean, I must live it, too.\n\nIf I\u2019m not doing my inner healing work to decondition the shit that gets in the way of my authentic embodiment, that will be loud and clear.\n\nIf I am not making choices aligned with my inner wisdom, that is the message that will come across.\n\nIf I am choosing people pleasing over authenticity, that is the vibe people will pick up.\n\nNo matter what I say.\n\nAnd here is what I know for sure about embodiment and alchemy:\n\nYou can only heal what you can see.\n\nOur intention to live in alignment with the highest potential of our purpose is the beginning. It is the match that lights the fires of our seeing. It is thespark of alchemy.\n\nYour intention is like a message to your soul that says:\n\nPlease show me all the \u201creasons\u201d why I don\u2019t do what I say I want to do. Make it so fucking clear that I can\u2019t deny it anymore. Write it so big and bold that I can get out of my way.\n\nAnd, uh, that shit is messy.\n\nBut, the bullshit new age rhetoric often tells us that all we have to do is put some shit on a vision board, and it will manifest into reality.\n\nSo, you expect rainbows, butterflies, and pop culture magic. And when it doesn\u2019t go like that, you will give up and fall into a hole of shame. You will think you are broken and not worthy of your heartfelt desires.\n\nAsk me how I know.\n\nBecause I have fallen into those same traps, afraid of how others will see me, I\u2019ve held back and pretended not to be the force of nature I AM.\n\nThose traps are a firehose on the spark.\n\nThe promise of alchemy allows us to be seen in our fullness, our wholeness, and our true magick.\n\nBut it isn\u2019t supposed to go perfectly. Becoming a person of high-frequency purpose and contribution doesn\u2019t bypass your humanity.\n\nIt is your doorway into it.\n\nAnd when you expect (and celebrate) the shit to hit the fan instead of a fairy tale, you can navigate it with Grace instead of self-hatred.\n\nYou can meet the parts of yourself that are terrified of being seen and create the love, belonging, and safety they need to shine. You can be the very love that you crave.\n\nThat alchemy is where the potential for embodied purpose lives.\n\nI would even be so bold as to say that your intentions are inevitable when you know how to navigate the natural flow of alchemy.\n\n(You\u2019ll learn \u201chow\u201d in theHuman Design Map & Portal.)\n\nAt the end of the day, I can\u2019t approach Human Design without bringing all of that in. Mercury won\u2019t let me.\n\nBecause it would mean denying authentic parts of myself, which would defeat the purpose entirely.\n\nToday, I am boldly vocal and upfront about my alchemical approach to Human Design. When you come into my world, I will not pretend that knowing this or that about your design is the secret sauce. And I will not hide the necessity of inner healing work from you.\n\nNo matter whichhuman design gatesare in yourincarnation crossor mercury gates, expanding your consciousness and making your most valuable contribution in the world requires the spark of alchemy.\n\nYou literally can\u2019t have one without the other. Mercury will be sure of that.\u00a0If you want to master the inner alchemy required to overcome people-pleasing and embody the highest frequency of your purpose, you will love theHuman Design Map & Portal.

And because the 54 has a deep inner knowing that all paths lead to the Divine, it is empowered to master the material plane (time, money, resources) as a path to spiritual growth.\n\nOn the \u201cnegative\u201d end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 54 is the energy for having blind ambition that takes you nowhere and leaves you feeling bitter. The 54 can be prone to giving up too quickly when results aren\u2019t instant.\n\nYou\u2019ll learn about the surprising (but most effective) way to raise your energy frequency in theHuman Design Map + Portal.\n\nIn the meantime, start noticing when you are feeling passive, obsessed or self-absorbed but don\u2019t be an asshole to yourself. Treat yourself the way you would a small child \u2013 with love, curiosity, and understanding.\n\n### My Personal Experience with Human Design Gate 54 (Gene Key 54)\n\nI must tell you that gate 54 holds a near and dear place in my heart.\n\nTechnically, Gate 54 isundefinedin my bodygraph. But, when you look at my astrological chart through the lens of theHuman Design gates, it is the gate in my Midheaven.\n\nIn astrology, our Midheaven holds important clues about our career, reputation, and the legacy that we will leave in the world.\n\nAs a Projector, I am hardwired to crave wild success \u2013 the kind that blows your mind with possibility. And I\u2019m also a contemplative mystic.\n\nMyincarnation cross,the Left Angle Cross of the Clarion 2 (57\/51, 62\/61) speaks to my life\u2019s work and purpose being of a spiritual nature.\n\n(I\u2019ll explain how the four gates of your incarnation cross work together inside yourHuman Design Map.)\n\nAs long as I can remember, I\u2019ve been deeply connected to the unseen realms. It has always been clear to me that pulling a thread over here impacts the one over there. And, of course, I am deeply fascinated by the golden thread that some call God.\n\nLike many mystics before me, I\u2019ve understood that we didn\u2019t incarnate on earth to \u201cbe spiritual\u201d or to \u201ctranscend\u201d the human experience. And that \u201cGod\u201d isn\u2019t the angry, vengeful, codependent beast that many find in the Bible.\n\nWe are incarnated tobeHuman. To play hide and seek with our Divinity in the game called life.\n\nAsRam Dasswould say,being here nowis the whole point.\n\nIn the east, they have a concept about householders versus renunciants, and have the wisdom to understand that most of us are incarnate to be householders. Meaning, we are \u201cmeant\u201d to have mouths to feed, bills to pay, a body to keep safe, and a life immersed in \u201cthe real world.\u201d\n\nAnd while giving up those \u201cworldly\u201d needs may be just the right thing for some, for most of us, we don\u2019t need to give up living in the real world to be \u201cworthy\u201d in the eyes of \u201cGod.\u201d\n\nFirst of all, because worthiness is not real; it\u2019s a made up construct by the ego. But, somewhere along the way, I bought into the lie that \u201cspiritual people\u201d shouldn\u2019t have earthbound ambitions.\n\nAnd, long before theHuman Design Mapbecame a thing, or I knew anything about astrology, being in business showed me that an important part of my spiritual path is material mastery.\n\nIn the beginning, I was shocked to discover that \u201cwanting to help people\u201d doesn\u2019t make my grocery bill or mortgage disappear. And running a business requires so much more than offering value to other people. (Want unbelievable value?Get your map here!)\n\nIn addition to providing goods or services, running a business requires \u201creal world\u201d skills like sales, marketing, administration, managing people, delegation, wise decision making, and a deep grasp on the cold, hard numbers.\n\nThe reality is that if you keep your head in the sand about all that, you will quickly be applying for a j-o-b.\n\nAnd let\u2019s be honest: I\u2019m unemployable with my sassy mouth. \ud83e\udd23\n\nAs all of that started to sink in, I saw that to create true success and prosperity, Icouldn\u2019tchoose between my spiritual life and my worldly ambition. It had to be both.\n\nI started to wonder if maybe my wild success would come when I used my desire for prosperity and material mastery as the way to grow and expand my definition of \u201cGod.\u201d\n\nThat perhaps success wouldn\u2019t happen in spite of being a contemplative mystic butbecause of it.\n\nMaybe, just maybe, my business could become a playground where I faced myself in the deepest of ways. Becoming seen, recognized, and highly valued would be the ultimate invitation toconfront my stories, process my emotions, and face my shadows.\n\n(You will learn those skills inside theHuman Design Mapportal!)\n\nCome to find out\u2026All those people who say that you have to choose between success and spiritual devotion are wrong (for me).\n\nSurrendering to the mastery of business without sacrificing my body, mind, or spirit has led me to levels of spiritual growth that I could have never imagined.\u00a0 And the more success I see in my business, the more and more true that becomes.\n\nI\u2019ve come to understand \u2013 and what I hope my legacy will be \u2013 is that mastering the material plane is a beautiful path to spiritual expansion and growth.\n\nYour definition of that thing that some call God can actually become BIGGER when you embrace your ambitious parts. And, I for one, am so grateful to have come to this understanding.\n\nToday, my business is a wild success and keeps growing.\n\nTheHuman Design Maphas blown my mind repeatedly with possibilities. It is filled to the brim with a community of people who are healed by my words and transformed by the alchemical tools that I teach them to wield.\n\nAnd, more and more, I soften into the knowing that there is no need to sacrifice what is true for me, as a human being, along the way. The more I lean into what is true for me, the more successful I become.\n\nI easily provide for our financial needs, give to causes I deeply care about, and am devoted to my spiritual path. I am connected to my higher purpose and becoming clearer about what that means with each passing day.\n\nAnd hey, if that is what I become known for in this world, I\u2019m perfectly OK with that. Here\u2019s to both\/and.\n\n## Affirmations for Human Design Gate 54\n\nUsing your Human Design to create affirmations is a powerful way to activate the full potential of your chart. Here are some affirmations for Gate 54:\n\nMastering the material plane is my spiritual path.\n\nI am ambitious AF.\n\nI love to create prosperity for myself and others.\n\nInside yourHuman Design Map, you\u2019ll get a full list of empowering beliefs for your type + strategy, authority, profile, and all four gates of yourincarnation crossand show you how to go from affirmation to full-on embodiment.

If so, where did you pick up that idea, and are you willing to put it down now?\n\nWhat might life look like if you surrendered to being here, fully incarnate on Earth?\n\nI encourage you to take some time with these questions.

She was even one of the first to get aHuman Design Map.\n\nAnd though she was my client, she taught me so much about what faith in abundance actuallyfeelslike.\n\nThrough her, the concept of abundance moved from being theoretical to something tangible I could experience in my body. In witnessing her, I saw what abundance looks like in human form.\n\nShe has this tenacious AF spirit that is like riding on a wing and a prayer.\n\nShe has shown me that faith is everything. And not religious faith.\n\nSure, that may be the path for some. But as we head into the 2027 transition, cultivating faith in the Divine that dwells within is how we will thrive.\n\nFaith in your own spirit. Faith that if you can dream it, it is already yours. Faith that life is a table and we are here to feast.\n\nWhat has become clear to me is that faith doesn\u2019t look like sitting around and hoping for some mystical savior to come along.\n\nYes, there are guides in both the natural and spirit realms.\n\nBut those guides are always a mirror of your own inner wisdom.\u00a0YOU are the guru.\n\nAnd faith is showing up and working with what you\u2019ve got.\n\nIt\u2019s Creative, with a capital C, as Leah says, and it is about cultivating an intentional relationship with the part of you that already knows and trusts in the abundance of life.\n\nFaith is trusting that when you ask, it is given.\n\nFaith knows that we aren\u2019t given dreams as a torture tactic \u2013 they are for our becoming.\n\nThe things we most desire out of life are catalysts for knowing our spiritual essence and aligning with our higher purpose.\n\n(This is one of the bazillion reasons I love Human Design. It gives context to the things we\u2019ve always wanted and is the clearestmap for aligning with your higher purpose.)\n\nFaith is allowing the spirit to dance through your every move. It is surrendering to the whole experience of being human.\n\nIt is being here now, feeling it all the way through, and finding the abundance in all of it.\n\n## Affirmations for Human Design Gate 55\n\nUsing your Human Design to create affirmations is a powerful way to activate the full potential of your chart.

Let me break the mechanics of that down a bit:\n\nVenus shows us where we find beauty in life, literally and metaphorically.It connects us to our values, deepens our relationships, and creates a sense of awe, wonder, and majesty.\n\nThe unconscious placements in our chart show us the main \u201cblocks\u201d andrejected shadow partsthat prevent flow on the conscious side.\n\nThe third line is about making mistakes, trial and error, and a deep willingness to figure things out.\n\nA placement in detriment shows us where we will tend to \u201cdefault\u201d tothe \u201clow\u201d frequency spectrumof any given energy and where we have a lot of potential for rewriting ourkarma.\n\n(If you are aHuman Design Map & Portalcustomer, check out the \u201cquick and dirty guide\u201d on Gate Nuances inside your portal.)\n\nAnd, holy shit, this potent combination of mechanics (Gate 56.3, in detriment, in my unconscious Venus) could not be more true for me.\n\nMy conscious Venus isHuman Design Gate 43\u2013 which is all about tuning in to the inner voice to create breakthroughs.\n\nOne of the most stunning things about life is the breakthrough that happens when we are deeply attuned to our inner wisdom.\n\nOf course, part of this is myHuman Design Gate 57(my conscious sun\/purpose) talking because we can only trust our intuition when we create the space and willingness to listen to it.\n\nBut I have endless stories (no pun intended!) of witnessing breakthroughs happen with others as a direct result of them going inside themselves. Watching these moments unfold brings tears to my eyes. The beauty of it astounds me (Venus).\n\n(This is why I love Human Design so much. It gives usa mapfor that kind of exploration.)\n\nWhen it comes to my own breakthroughs and opening up to the beauty within them, though, I have to be mindful of the stories I am telling myself. I am no stranger to making the stuff of life mean horrendous things.\n\n(We all do that sometimes!)\n\nWhen I am caught in one of those shitty stories, I shut down. My eyes close so tight that I can\u2019t see the beauty and majesty of what is. My inner wisdom becomes quiet, and a true breakthrough is locked out of my heart and mind.\n\nIn those moments, my work is to remember that self-compassion, grace, and opening to possibility are the first steps in telling a new story. We cannot transform our stories when they are steeped in shame, self-ridicule, and victim consciousness.\n\nAs I teach in the Art of Remembering (a bonus course in theHuman Design Map & Portal), the practice is remembering to remember.\n\nI remember by connecting with my purpose, the value I bring to the world, and separating the facts from the fiction. In that remembering, a new story is born.\n\nYes, by the mystery of Grace, shitties stories might be my first instinct. I will get caught in shitty stories again. And, because I am a human being, I will forget my purpose, my value, and that thoughts (stories) are not truth with a capital T.\n\nStories are choices; they are our free will.\n\nSo, I will keep letting go of the old stories, choosing new ones, and allowing myself to see the beauty of this life. I will stand in reverence as my breakthroughs come. And I will remember as many times as it takes.\n\nAnd so it is.\n\nIf you want to learn to tell a different story about yourself, you will love theHuman Design Map & Portal, a two-part experience for transforming your life with Human Design.\n\nFirst, you\u2019ll get a 100+ page guide\u2014made just for you\u2014that covers your Human Design type and strategy, authority, profile, and all four gates of your incarnation cross.

It is my \u201cDivine Invitation\u201d to trust my intuition and create the kind of life that sets me up for intuitive clarity.\n\nAnd, well, it has been a journey.\n\nFor most of my life, I was on a path of repeatedly ignoring my intuition and regretting it later.\n\nI would get very clear NO signals but I would discount them. My thoughts would convince me that my intuition was illogical and therefore, untrustworthy.\n\nI had disintegratedshadowsaround being weird, crazy, or \u201ctoo\u201d suspicious. I never wanted others to judge me as odd or strange for my \u201cillogical\u201d decisions.\n\n(You\u2019ll learn the shadows of your design inside theHuman Design Mapand learn how to integrate them inside themapportal.)\n\nThat completely shifted when I had a session with a healer who focused on helping others reclaim their intuitive gifts.\n\nI told her about an experience I\u2019d had with a well known business coach.\n\nMy colleagues wouldn\u2019t shut up talking about this guy. But when I visited his website,\u00a0 my whole body said NO and I felt immediately suspicious.\n\nBut, in my mind, I believed that because \u201call the cool kids\u201d were hiring this person, that I should too. I thought that, clearly, my body was wrong and that I should do what everyone else was doing on.\n\nYou know what they say about jumping off of bridges?\n\nWell, I jumped. And while I won\u2019t get into all of the details of what went down, I will say that my suspicions were 100% spot the fuck on.\n\nAs I was telling the healer that story, she stopped me and she said something that would change my life forever (Human Design Gate 23vibes!).\n\nShe said:\n\n\u201cYour suspicion is your intuition.\u201d\n\nMy mind was so blown. Literally blown.\n\nI cannot tell you how many times I\u2019d felt suspicious in my life only to be told that I was being too sensitive (Human Design Gate 19) or ungracious (Human Design Gate 22). And, of course, only to realize later that I was right the whole time.\n\nBut, because I\u2019d made suspicion wrong in my mind, I ignored it.\n\nAfter that session with her, though, I started to pay extra close attention to sensations of suspicion, mistrust, and leeriness. If I picked up \u201cbad vibes\u201d at all, I started trusting them more and more.\n\nI would walk away, no questions asked. And if people thought I was weird, strange, odd, crazy, or whatever, they could fuck right off with that noise.\n\nI live by my intuition, not by other people\u2019s thoughts. I embrace my weirdness. ;)\n\nBy the time I found Human Design, I was alreadydoing a ton of deconditioningaround my intuition. But, learning my design helped me take it to a whole new level.\n\n(I\u2019ll guide you through deconditioning inside theHuman Design Mapportal and integration course.)\n\nMy spleen is heavily defined and, according to Human Design, I have splenic authority.\n\nThat means my NO is essential to my safety and wellbeing.\n\nSo, now, my focus is all about peeling back all the ways my body says NO to things. Not just sensations like suspicion or \u201cbad vibes\u201d but things that don\u2019t sound, smell, taste, look \u201cright\u201d are also ways my body says NO.\n\nI\u2019d be lying if I said that I trust those signals every time.\n\nBut, thankfully, I have compassion and Grace for myself. I know that with gate 57 in my conscious sun, my relationship with my intuition isn\u2019t supposed to be all rainbows and butterflies.\n\nThere is \u201csupposed to be\u201d some grit there. And I have surrendered to the knowing that I will be on a lifelong journey of expanding my capacity to trust my intuition.\n\nWhat I can say, though, with 100% certainty, is that leaning into my intuition more and more has changed the quality of my life in ways I could have never imagined.\n\nI am truly thriving. Life isn\u2019t perfect, of course, because it isn\u2019t supposed to be. Earth is a place of duality.\n\nBut, my relationships are thriving. My business is booming. Themapportal conversations I get to have with people, from all over the world, blow my mind.\n\nMy body is becoming healthier and healthier.\n\nAnd, more importantly, that I actually trust myself.

Gate 58 knows that we must face the source of our unhappiness if we want to live that is rooted in joy. When we do that, we are empowered to experience the joy in life\u2026just by being alive.\n\nOn the \u201cnegative\u201d end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 58 is the energy forseeking joy from external factors rather than internal cultivation, it allows stress and pressure to override joy.\n\nYou\u2019ll learn about the surprising (but most effective) way to raise your energy frequency in theHuman Design Map + Portal.\n\nIn the meantime, start noticing when you are feeling ungrounded, high strung or stressed out, but don\u2019t be an asshole to yourself. Treat yourself the way you would a small child \u2013 with love, curiosity, and understanding.\n\n### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 58 (Gene Key 58)\n\nLet me tell you\u2026\n\nI am no stranger to believing that joy and happiness come from the outside \u2014 other people, stuff, food, etc.\n\nAt one time in my life, nothing \u201cmade me happier\u201d than going to Target, grabbing a latte, and browsing the aisles for the latest and greatest thing.\n\nI complained if people didn\u2019t behave as I thought they should. I huffed, and I puffed. I raged all around me.\n\nWhen I was unhappy at work, I\u2019d look for a new job. When I was disappointed with my boyfriend, I broke up with him. When I \u201chad nothing to wear,\u201d I\u2019d go buy more clothes.\n\nBut, no matter how much stuff I accumulated, how much food I ate, and how many boys liked me, it was never enough.\n\nAnd I know I\u2019m not alone in that. I see it all the time with my clients inside themapportal, too. Some people even use their Human Design chart as the new thing to blame when things aren\u2019t working out the way they hoped.\n\nTo be clear, I don\u2019t say that in a judgmental way. I say it with a deep ache in my heart because I know how painful that state of being is.\n\nAlong the way, we get glimmers of what it means to be in our full power; to abide in the kind of joy that can only come from trusting ourselves.\n\nAnd we want to surrender to voice of our higher self and inner wisdom so fucking bad it hurts. But making the leap into trusting oneself, after decades of making everyone and everything responsible for your happiness, is a form of ego death. The structures that held up our victim consciousness must burn down before we can create a new way of being.\n\nAnd that is because of two things:\n\nFirst, Earth is a world of contrast.\n\nWe didn\u2019t incarnate to be blissed out all the time. There are rainbows,\u00a0 butterflies, and maybe even unicorns \ud83d\ude09. But there are also hurricanes, systems of oppression, famine, and war.\n\nWe came to expand our consciousness; to play the game of hide and seek with Divine selves. And that expansion comes through the love and acceptance of theshadow.\n\nThe contrast of life provides the grit necessary to polish and buff out the karma that keeps you trapped in the illusion of separateness.\n\nOn a practical level, that looks like owning your experience and not giving people, your clothes, your bank account, or the cute pillow at target the power to control your inner state of being.\n\nYour thoughts, feelings, and emotions come from how your nervous system interprets the facts of life. And they are compounded by the meaning you make about yourself, the world, and that thing that some call God.\n\nNow, for the love of all things holy, don\u2019t mistake what I mean here.\n\nI\u2019m not saying that if you \u201cjust think positive,\u201d you\u2019ll be happy all the time, that you should stay in miserable situations because they are your fault, or that you are to blame for everything you\u2019ve experienced.Blame and responsibility are two different things.\n\nBlame is about looking to the past to find fault; it comes from fighting with reality and the delusion that you can change the past. Blame gives your power away and leaves you powerless.\n\nResponsibility is looking at what is true right now, eyes wide open, and deciding what you\u2019ll do to move forward. Responsibility is where all of your power to live authentically comes from.\n\nThe good news is that your brain and nervous system are malleable like clay and you can stop blaming life (or yourself) and you can start choosing new interpretations, expand your capacity for joy, and create new default patterns.\n\nYour Human Design gives you amapfor that journey. And, inside the portal, you\u2019ll learn \u201chow\u201d to expand your capacity for joy by no longer giving your power away and by surrendering to your inner wisdom.Get your map and portal access here.\n\nIn the meantime, know this:\n\nDeep joy is available to you.\n\nTo experience it, you must start by taking full responsibility for your own well-being. You have to stop giving your power away to the world around you. You must remember that\u2026\n\n\u2026If you need your boss to be a certain way for you to be happy, you\u2019re in for a crapshoot.\n\n\u2026If you buy that cute pillow at Target, once it\u2019s been in your living room for a little while, you aren\u2019t even going to notice it anymore.\n\n\u2026If it\u2019s raining outside, hating the weather does nothing to change it.\n\nBut when you recognize that your wellbeing is an inside job and that you have what it takes to be your own hero,\u00a0 then, and only then do you have a solid foundation for expansive joy.\n\nAnd it\u2019s delightful. Go on that journey inside theHuman Design Mapportal.\n\n## Affirmations for Human Design Gate 58\n\nUsing your Human Design to create affirmations is a powerful way to activate the full potential of your chart.

Treat yourself the way you would a small child \u2013 with love, curiosity, and understanding.\n\n### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 59 (Gene Key 59)\n\nGate 59 (line 5) is defined in my unconscious mars placement. According to theGene Keys, our unconscious mars is the core wound we carry in our relationships and becomes our vocation as we heal those wounds.\n\n(If you are one of myHuman Design Mapclients and are a business owner, go to the Human Design and Business quick and dirty guide inside the map portal for more information about how vocation relates to marketing! There is a login link at the bottom of this email. )\n\nUnderstanding the symbolism of the 59 as my core wound was nothing short of a holy revelation.\n\nI have often been called an \u201coversharer\u201d because I\u2019ve never really been afraid to share intimate details about my life.\n\nI do have lines I don\u2019t cross, of course, but I do tend to be more open, honest, and willing to risk emotional rejection than a lot of people. I\u2019ll answer almost any question people ask and see great value in sharing my authentic experience.\n\nBut, holy shit, being an \u201cover-sharer\u201d has created so much freaking pain in my life.\n\nIt took me a long time to understand that being \u201ctoo\u201d vulnerable was such a great source of suffering.\n\nWe are so often told that we \u201cshould be more vulnerable\u201d and I took that to the max.\n\nBut, as Brene so wisely says, we need to be discerning about our vulnerability and that we should only share with those that have earned the right to hear our story.\n\nPerhaps it was my Projector energy that so desperately wanted to be recognized or my undefined will trying to prove something, but I often found myself sharing intimate details and having them fall on deaf ears.\n\nOnce, I shared a painful experience in my life with someone that I genuinely thought was my friend and they very plainly responded with:\n\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t that kind of friends.\u201d\n\nI can look back on that and respect her boundaries.\n\nBut at the time, it was heart-wrenching.\n\nSadly, it didn\u2019t stop me. In fact, I doubled down on vulnerability and found myself in multiple situations where my vulnerability was used as a weapon against me.\n\nWith the help of Gene Keys and Brene Brown\u2019s words, I started to wise up, though.\n\nI started to pay more attention to who had \u201cearned the right\u201d to my vulnerability. Probably more importantly, I started to pay close attention to who was critical of my vulnerable nature.\n\nAre they daring greatly, as Theodore Roosevelt said?\n\nAre they in the arena?\n\nAre they doing something with their lives that I admire?\n\nOr are they just being an armchair critic?\n\nAre they using my vulnerability for their own gain or were they willing to traverse it with me to create more connection and intimacy?\n\nThe answers to those questions really matter and help guide me as I encounter \u201cfeedback\u201d about my level of vulnerability.\n\nI\u2019d love to say that it never hurts when my vulnerability isn\u2019t received well. Because it still does sometimes. I am a human being with normal human feelings, afterall.\n\nBut, I am more discerning. And in the times I get it wrong, I\u2019m learning to let go of attachment to how my sharing is received. True to the 5th line, I am trusting that what other people think about me is on them, and that when I share with the people who do truly love me, it sets the stage for others to do the same.\n\nAnd that risk is worth it to me. Because I do want to live in a world where we can deeply understand one another and that can only happen through vulnerability, honesty, and willingness to risk other people\u2019s opinions.\n\n## Affirmations for Human Design Gate 59\n\nUsing your Human Design to create affirmations is a powerful way to activate the full potential of your chart. Here are some affirmations for Gate 59:\n\nI create intimacy through vulnerability.\n\nI initiate others into the ways of healthy and sustainable relationships.\n\nI give birth to new life.\n\nInside yourHuman Design Map, you\u2019ll get a full list of empowering beliefs for your type + strategy, authority, profile, and all four gates of yourincarnation crossand show you how to go from affirmation to full-on embodiment.

I know I say that a lot, for different reasons, but this one is deeply connected to truly understanding my gifts and the value I bring to the world.\n\nMy very firstmapcustomer has gate 60 in their conscious sun.\n\nBack then, I didn\u2019t know thehuman design gatesthe way that I do now. I hadn\u2019t quite realized that the gates \u201cspeak to me\u201d and that I had a natural affinity with them. And it was gate 60 that cracked open that door.\n\nI can remember very clearly sitting down to study gate 60.\n\nI was surrounded by piles ofHuman Design, Gene Keys, and IChing books. I was taking notes as fast as my hand would go.\n\nBy the end, I had tears streaming down my face because I knew how important it was to get this information out to people.\n\nAnd, in a moment ofself recognition, I knew I had a unique, more empowering way of translating the system. I saw, clear as day, why people had been begging me to explain their design to them.\n\nI understood my gifts in a whole new way. I was more than \u201cjust a writer\u201d or walking, talking firehose of esoteric information. In those moments, I knew that my words would change the way people experience their Human Design.\n\nTraditional Human Design is often taught in a disempowering way.\n\nThere are literally \u201canalysts\u201d and \u201creaders\u201d who tell people, based on specific gates in their chart, that they are evil, doomed to fail, or other such disempowering bullshit.\n\nI once had an HD reader tell me that I should close my business, file for unemployment, and play video games for the rest of my life.\n\nAnd that is just the beginning of what I\u2019ve seen.\n\nThere are indeed some gates in the chart that, because of conditioning and Ra\u2019s intention to reach people through their \u201cnot-self,\u201d can seem intense at first glance.\n\nBut a different story unfolds when we look deeper at thefull spectrum of potential.\n\nGate 60 is one of the prime examples.\n\nIn traditional Human Design, gate 60 is known as the gate of limitation. It is the energy of boundaries, structure, and restriction.\n\nSome pretty gnarly shit has gone down when gate 60 wastransitingplanets like Saturn, Uranus, Pluto, etc.\u00a0And, my firstmapclient definitely didn\u2019t have a life of skipping through fields of flowers, rainbows, and butterflies either.\n\nAll of that is true.\n\nAND\n\nThere is a whole other side of the story.\n\nWhile writing that very firstmap, with gate 60 as the conscious sun, the other side was blazingly obvious.\n\nI didn\u2019t see limitations, rigid structure, or smackdowns from life.\n\nI saw potential, creativity, and ingenuity.\n\nI saw magick.\n\nBecause here is the thing:\n\nCreativity and magick are BORN from limits.\n\nYour house is safe because of its walls. Rivers need banks to flow. iPhones, cars, and GPS were all created to solve a \u201climitation.\u201d\n\nSome of the most beautiful art in the world was made with leftover paint and brushes that should have long been in the trash.\n\nAs they say, necessity is the mother of invention.\n\nWithout limits, boundaries, and problems, there is no need for creativity and magick. They are fuel for our evolution and growth as a species.\n\nHumans find a way. We make something out of nothing. We create from the (root) pressure of limits. We make magick with it.\n\nHow could it be any other way? It\u2019s how the game is played.\n\nAnd I am 100% on board with that. It is actually what I teach inside theHuman Design Mapportal. Your chart isn\u2019t a fate written in stone; it is a tool for your creativity and deepest alchemical transformation.\n\nThe difference is in attitude and using our so-called limitations as an opportunity. It is looking for the potential inside of limitation.\n\nIt is embracing our real limitations and letting the perceived one\u2019s go. Just like a river and its banks. Gate 60 is what makes us truly limitless.\n\nEmbrace the magick of your chart by getting yourmapand going on the journey inside the portal.\n\n## Affirmations for Human Design Gate 60\n\nUsing your Human Design to create affirmations is a powerful way to activate the full potential of your chart. Here are some affirmations for Gate 60:\n\nI trust that limitation is the seed of creativity.\n\nMagic and creativity flow through my boundaries.\n\nI work with nature instead of against it.\n\nInside yourHuman Design Map, you\u2019ll get a full list of empowering beliefs for your type + strategy, authority, profile, and all four gates of yourincarnation crossand show you how to go from affirmation to full-on embodiment.

And it provides the spiritual foundation necessary to unlock the expanded consciousness in the other gates of yourincarnation cross.(I\u2019ll explain all four gates of yourincarnation crossin theHuman Design Map.)\n\nSo, my path to \u201cGod\u201d is reveling in the mystery of life; in being a contemplative mystic, looking for the golden thread in all things. In doing so, I unlock the full potential of my gifts and purpose.\n\nAnd, OMG (no pun intended), what a ride it has been.\n\nI actually have the full channel (61-24) defined in my chart.\n\nAs far back as I can remember, I have felt deeply connected with the mystery of life and the Divinity of everything.\n\nBut, I was raised in a religious context that believed there was one, and only one, path to \u201cGod.\u201d\n\nI\u2019d sit in church completely confused.\n\nI could feel the Golden Threads of Truth running through the sermons.

Never mind the gossip, bold-faced hypocrisy, and isms as deep as the ocean (racism, sexism, classism, etc.).\n\nMy relationship with the \u201cGod\u201d of my childhood unraveled very early.\n\nI remember being 18 years old, pissed off at my parents, and yelling that I didn\u2019t believe in God.\n\nIn hindsight (and true togate 24), I can clearly see that it had nothing to do with believing in \u201cGod.\u201d\n\nI just didn\u2019t believe in the God they believed in. And I didn\u2019t know that what I believe (about anything, including God) is a choice. I was completely unaware of the free will to select the way we think.\n\nAll of that changed when, through the mystery of Grace, I stumbled onto the work ofRichard Rohr.\n\nThe first book I read of his was calledFalling Upward. And, as they say in the East, a meeting with the Divine and the river changes course.\n\nMy interpretation of what he says is this:\n\nWhen terrible things happen, we try to reconcile those things with the God that we believe in. And if we can\u2019t do that reconciliation, we have two choices.\n\nWe can make God \u201csmall\u201d by collapsing our definition of it. Or, we can make God \u201cbigger\u201d by expanding our definition of it.\n\n\u201cIn order to see God, you have to have special eyes. Otherwise, you cannot bear the shock.\u201d ~Neem Karoli Baba\n\nThe idea that I could make God bigger shocked me; it was the first of many spiritual awakenings.\n\nI saw that when I told my parents that God isn\u2019t real, it was because I had collapsed my definition of God. I hadn\u2019t known I could make my definition of God big enough to hold the trauma I was carrying.\n\nBut, in Richard Rohr\u2019s book, I saw I had a choice.\n\nTrue to the 61-24, from that moment on, I began to revisit my definition of God repeatedly. It became my spiritual practice to make God big enough to holdallmy experiences, even the horrible ones.\n\nSince then, I have studied spiritual traditions and beliefs from all over the world. I\u2019ve looked for the Golden Thread that runs through them all, and I opened myself up to more powerful ways of thinking about God.\n\nI\u2019ve resonated most with Hermeticism (aka magick) and traditions from the East. What has been most interesting, though, is that I also really enjoy learning about the different ways people interpret the Bible and seeing those old sermons in a whole new way.\n\nAll of these things shape the way I live, the way I write, and the way I teach Human Design through themap + portal.\n\nMost importantly, though, I\u2019ve stopped believing that there is only one path to that thing that some call God. Instead, there are64 archetypesplaying out in a gazillion and one ways.\n\nI\u2019ve realized that Truth is subjective and that our inner wisdom is what guides our truth.\n\nWe tend to think of Truth as being objective. But, most of the things we believe are \u201cthe truth\u201d are really just thoughts, beliefs, and ideas. They are inherited from our conditioning, rather than chosen on purpose.\n\nThe realgood newsis that thoughts and beliefs are always optional.\n\nWe don\u2019t \u201chave to\u201d believe anything.\n\nWe are all just making it up as we go along.\n\nNo one knows for sure.\n\nA younger version of me would have been terrified at that idea; it gives me so much freedom now.\n\n\u201cWhat I know\n\nIs that I don\u2019t know.\n\nSo I dance, and I sing, and I live full.\n\nI give it all to the call of the unknown.\u201d\n\nTrevor Hall, The Fruitful Darkness, What I Know\n\nI can now play, experiment, and see what resonates. If something doesn\u2019t resonate, I can let it go. And if it does, I can hold it lightly enough to let it go if it starts to feel like I\u2019m collapsing or if it bounds me up in attachments.\n\nThis surrender to \u201cnot knowing\u201d is the spiritual underpinning that informs my approach to Human Design. And it is why me and my team are devoted to pointing people back to their inner knowing inside theHuman Design Map + Portal.\n\nI\u2019m not attached to the idea that there is only one way to use Human Design, that what Ra said was the ultimate Truth, or that you can get it wrong. That feels ways too small for me.\n\nInstead, I choose to believe that my soul is always on the \u201cright\u201d path \u2013 even if it looks nothing like my chart. I choose to believe that God is everything \u2013 there is nothing that is not Divine. I trust what resonates in my body and lands with holiness. The mystery always plays out perfectly.\n\nAnd so it is.\n\n## Affirmations for Human Design Gate 61\n\nUsing your Human Design to create affirmations is a powerful way to activate the full potential of your chart.

For Gate 62, transformation begins by understanding the details \u2013 especially what is objective versus subjective \u2013 and transforming those details into precise and clear language. This in turn helps others to create transformation in their lives.\n\nOn the \u201cnegative\u201d end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 62 is the energy for using its logic and knowledge to hide insecurities; it obsesses with facts, details, organizing, and planning. It can also get trapped in information seeking or become overwhelmed when ideas don\u2019t seem \u201cworkable.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ll learn about the surprising (but most effective) way to raise your energy frequency in theHuman Design Map + Portal.\n\nThe most important thing to raise the frequency of gate 62 is to get (inner) clarity about the relevant amount of facts, details, and planning necessary to create solutions. And to remember that you are not your thoughts.\n\n### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 62 (Gene Key 62)\n\nGate 62 is defined in the unconscious sun of myincarnation cross.\n\nAas someone obsessed withshadowintegration and parts work, the unconscious sun is one of the most interesting gates of the whole chart.\n\nThe unconscious side of the chart reveals the wounds, the golden shadow parts, and the stories that keep us stuck and prevent the full potential of our purpose and contribution on the conscious side of the chart.\n\nThe unconscious sun in particular represents the part of ourselves that is actually our most attractive quality to the world (in a platonic way).\n\nBut, it doesn\u2019t always feel that way on the inside because it is also where we \u201cstore\u201d our self-doubt and \u201cnot-enoughness.\u201d And, it is a doorway that opens our Golden Shadows. Once we recognize the magick that is our unconscious sun, we begin a journey of healing all of the shadows on the unconscious side.\n\n(With yourHuman Design Map & Portal, you will discover the golden and taboo shadows of your type, authority, profile, and all four gates of your incarnation cross. And, the best part of all, you will learn how to heal the shadows that keep you stuck in people pleasing, indecision, and not trusting yourself.Get yours here.)\n\nFor me, with Gate 62 in my unconscious sun, it means that my way with words is highly magnetic to the people around me.\n\nMy whole life, people have commented on my ways with words, especially the way I can organize and explain esoteric concepts. They love how I break things down and make even convoluted concepts (like Human Design!) seem clear.\n\nI\u2019m celebrated for step-by-step guidance, clear and piercing language, and busting myths. Yourmap and portalare loaded with it.\n\nBut what most people don\u2019t see or understand is that, while these things do come quite naturally to me, they have also been my deepest sources of inner turmoil. \ud83d\ude32\n\nFor most of my life, I would beat myself up about not knowing how to explain things. Or not being specific enough. Or not giving enough details.\n\nNot enough. Not enough. Not enough.\n\nIn many ways, these insecurities have also been a source of deep bitterness because the story of \u201cnot enough\u201d almost always leads to people-pleasing, an imbalance in giving and receiving, and wasting a lot of energy \u201cmaking sure\u201d I\u00a0 have all the facts before speaking.\n\nBut, when I understood the nature of the unconscious sun, it unlocked something for me that really changed this dynamic.\n\nI started to notice those insecurities instead of acting them out.\n\nI felt the feelings. I did the shadow integration work. I reclaimed the fractured parts of my power. And I started making conscious choices about how I\u2019d show up for my writing and step-by-step guidance.\n\n(That is exactly what you will learn how to do in theHuman Design Map & Portal.)\n\nI stopped letting those not-enough stories prevent me from showing up with integrity. I\u2019ve become willing to refine as I gather details, facts, or information. I don\u2019t seek perfection. And I trust the evolution of my consciousness.\n\nI\u2019ve also come to understand that staying on the leading edge of awareness is a huge part of why I can explain things so easily. I am deeply attuned to the words, phrases, and ways of explaining things that create confusion. I am not married to the words that cause more harm than good and am not afraid to go back to the drawing board when necessary.\n\nAnd, true to the unconscious sun placement, the more I\u2019ve done that inner healing work, the more recognition I receive about the esoteric translator that radiates from my being.\n\nA day doesn\u2019t go by where I don\u2019t hear a compliment about my way with words or the way I break things down. I am honored to say that, insidethe map portal, I receive abundant praise and recognition for what I do.\n\nAnd the practice of receiving that recognition encourages me to trust that my way with words is enough. And that it is safe to let go, on deeper and deeper levels, the idea that I\u2019m saying the wrong thing or not explaining things well.\n\nIt is all unfolding perfectly. And what a beautiful expanding spiral of transformation it is.\n\n## Affirmations for Human Design Gate 62\n\nUsing your Human Design to create affirmations is a powerful way to activate the full potential of your chart. Here are some affirmations for Gate 62:\n\nI have a powerful way with words.\n\nI make rocket science seem like child\u2019s play.\n\nI easily break down concepts into language that others can understand.\n\nInside yourHuman Design Map, you\u2019ll get a full list of empowering beliefs for your type + strategy, authority, profile, and all four gates of yourincarnation crossand show you how to go from affirmation to full-on embodiment.

Gate 63 sees distorted energy as an opportunity for truth, therefore, it asks itself and others powerful questions. And the answer to those questions shatter doubt, impossibility, and hesitation and reveal the true potential that exists in all things.\n\nOn the \u201cnegative\u201d end of the spectrum, Human Design Gate 63 is the energy of struggling with self-doubt or planting unnecessary doubt into others\u2019 minds. It never takes action due to doubt and blames external things for the doubt and their results.\n\nYou\u2019ll learn about the surprising (but most effective) way to raise your energy frequency in theHuman Design Map + Portal.\n\nIn the meantime, start noticing when you are feeling fearful, obsessive or like a victim, but don\u2019t be an asshole to yourself. Treat yourself the way you would a small child \u2013 with love, curiosity, and understanding.\n\n### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 63 (Gene Key 63)\n\nGate 63 is undefined in my chart, but I have a defined Head\/Ajna. So, I am intimately familiar with how the head pressures the Ajna with questions.\n\nWhen we don\u2019t keep those questions in check, it can send us in all sorts of unhelpful directions.\n\nThe main question that gate 63 asks is what.\n\nAnd my \u201cflavor\u201d of gate 63 questions has been:\n\nWhat is wrong with me?\n\nWhat am I missing?\n\nWhat am I doing wrong?\n\nDoubt. Doubt. Doubt.\n\nFor a long time, I thought that experiencing doubt meant that I was too broken or messed up to do much of anything with my life.\n\nWhen I noticed doubt, I made it mean imminent failure and that I would never succeed.\n\nThings started to shift in 2014 when I went to a coaching mastermind in Napa Valley.\n\nThe weather was gorgeous. I was delighted to be connecting with so many like-minded people. The deep conversations were spectacular, and I met people I am still friends with.\n\nI was absolutely high on life. Truth be told, I was probably high on the amplification of such \u201cpositive\u201d sacral and solar plexus energy, but whatever.\n\nAnyway, during one of the mastermind sessions, there was a group Q + A with my mentor. She always appeared confident in her ability to create the life she wanted, and I was convinced that she never experienced doubt.\n\nI hesitantly asked\u2026\n\nDo you ever feel doubt?\n\nIn her confident voice, she replied:\n\nOf course, I just don\u2019t let it drive my actions.\n\nIt took me some time to really sink into the meaning of her words.\n\nI can\u2019t say for sure what they really meant for her.\n\nBut what I have come to understand, and teach others inside theHuman Design Map, is that we are \u201cmeant\u201d to experience it all.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be in the chart if it weren\u2019t a normal part of the human experience.\n\nDoubt is not actually a problem. Nothing is going wrong when doubt shows up \u2013 for any reason. It only becomes a problem when we assign meaning to it and use it as fuel for actions that keep us stuck in the low frequency of our purpose.\n\nBut, even more important is that we can transform the frequency of the doubt and turn it into fuel for actions aligned with our higher purpose.\n\nWe do that by seeing doubt as a signal to explore all of the possibilities.\n\nYou turn the doubt on its head (pun intended \ud83d\ude09) and let it open you up instead of shutting you down.\n\nThis, as with all things, is a process. You won\u2019t get it right on the first try. And you\u2019ll have to remind yourself repeatedly that doubt is evidence that you are a normal human being and nothing else.\n\nSince gate 63 is undefined in my chart, I\u2019ll be learning more ways of working with doubt as I continue through life.\n\nBut, for now, I am really grateful for what I\u2019ve learned so far, and I welcome more opportunities to expand my mind to what is really possible when we get out of our own way.If you want a guide on your path, invite me by getting yourHuman Design Map and reaching out to me inside the portal.\n\n## Affirmations for Human Design Gate 63\n\nUsing your Human Design to create affirmations is a powerful way to activate the full potential of your chart.

It can find itself worried about the \u201chow\u201d instead of focusing on the next step.\n\nYou\u2019ll learn about the surprising (but most effective) way to raise your energy frequency in theHuman Design Map + Portal.\n\nIn the meantime, start noticing when you are feeling anxious, confused or pessimistic, but don\u2019t be an asshole to yourself. Treat yourself the way you would a small child \u2013 with love, curiosity, and understanding.\n\n### My Personal Experience with Human DesignGate 64 (Gene Key 64)\n\nBack when I was doing one-to-one coaching, I had a client with the full 64\/47 channel of abstraction. She is a business coach for artists and we met because we did life coach training from the same place.\n\nIn that circle, confusion had a really bad wrap. And it was something we talked about many, many times.\n\nWith the 64\/47, confusion was an old friend and she had gotten into the habit of shaming herself for feeling confused.\n\nBut, what I helped her see is that, as with all energy, gate 64 (aka the energy of confusion) is ona spectrumand all ends of the spectrum are available to us.\n\nNone of it is right or wrong. It just is. And the key to your energetic success is knowing how to work with your energy. That is what you\u2019ll learn how to do when you get yourHuman Design Map.\n\nHere is an example of what that might look like in \u201creal\u201d life with the 64:\n\nImagine for a moment that you have been training to climb a mountain for 6 months straight. You go all in on your training and you have a deep inner knowing that you will make it to the top. You are clear and ready.\n\nBut, on the day you plan to start the actual climb, it is an incredibly foggy day. You cannot see the top of the mountain.\n\nOn the \u201cnegative\u201d end of the 64 spectrum, you would turn around and go home because you can\u2019t see, with your actual eyes, how you will get to the top. You \u201cindulge\u201d in not knowing the how.\n\nBut, on the \u201cpositive\u201d side of the 64 spectrum, you would proceed, knowing that you don\u2019t need to see the whole path. You just need to trust that you will make it to the top of the mountain by putting one foot in front of the other. You stay in the possibility instead of in the fog.\n\nSee the difference?\n\nWhen we let the metaphorical fog stop us from doing what we know to do and put one foot in front of the other, we never really get anywhere. But when we remember that fog is just a reminder that there is infinite potential on this crazy green spinning rock and that all we have to ever do is take the next step.\n\n\u201cConfusion clouds the heart but it also points the way.\u201dTrevor Hall, You can\u2019t Rush Your Healing, Kala\n\nWhen my client began practicing that, it changed everything for her. No more shaming herself for feeling confused and instead, alchemizing that into potent fuel for the very next step.\n\nClarity, via the a-ha moment of the47, is coming.\n\nAnd, quite honestly, it has changed everything for me, too.\n\nGate 64 is undefined in my chart (though I do have a defined head) and, over the course of my life, I have learned that you really do only need to be able to see the next step.\n\nAnd when you can surrender the how and just trust your knowing of the potential and possibilities, all tends to work itself out.\n\nThe right people will show up to help. The tools will become clear. The whole path will reveal itself at the end.\n\nSo, don\u2019t let confusion stop you. And don\u2019t let it become a weapon you use against yourself. Trust yourself. You do know what to do. Just put one foot in front of the other. And do that over and over again.\n\nAnd, if you feel \u201cblocked\u201d along the way, that is an indicator that there is some deconditioning to do. I\u2019ll show you the next steps inside theHuman Design Mapportal.\n\n## Affirmations for Human Design Gate 64\n\nUsing your Human Design to create affirmations is a powerful way to activate the full potential of your chart.
