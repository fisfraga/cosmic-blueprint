# 2 The Seven Hermetic Principles


"The Principles of Truth are Seven; he who knows these, understandingly, possesses the Magic Key before whose touch all the Doors of the Temple fly open."--The Kybalion.

The Seven Hermetic Principles, upon which the entire Hermetic Philosophy is based, are as follows:

1. The Principle of  [[Mentalism (philosophy)|Mentalism]] 
2. The Principle of Correspondence.
3. The Principle of Vibration.  
4. The Principle of Polarity.
5. The Principle of Rhythm.
6. The Principle of Cause and Effect.
7. The Principle of Gender.

These Seven Principles will be discussed and explained as we proceed with these lessons. A short explanation of each, however, may as well be given at this point.

1.  The Principle of Mentalism

> "THE ALL IS MIND; The Universe is Mental."--The Kybalion.

This Principle embodies the truth that "All is Mind." It explains that THE ALL (which is the Substantial  [[Reality]]  underlying all the outward  [[Theophany|manifestations]]  and appearances which we know under the terms of "The Material Universe"; the "Phenomena of Life"; "Matter"; "Energy"; and, in short, all that is apparent to our material  [[Sense|senses]] ) is SPIRIT which in itself is UNKNOWABLE and UNDEFINABLE, but which may be considered and  [[Thought]]  of as AN  [[Universal (metaphysics)|UNIVERSAL]] , INFINITE, LIVING MIND. It also explains that all the phenomenal world or universe is simply a Mental Creation of THE ALL, subject to the Laws of Created Things, and that the universe, as a  [[Holism|whole]] , and in its parts or units, has its  [[Existence]]  in the Mind of THE ALL, in which Mind we "live and move and have our being." This Principle, by establishing the Mental Nature of the Universe, easily explains all of the varied mental and  [[Parapsychology|psychic phenomena]]  that occupy such a large portion of the public  [[Attention]] , and which, without such  [[Explanation]] , are non-understandable and defy  [[Science|scientific]]  treatment. An understanding of this great Hermetic Principle of  [[Mentalism (psychology)|Mentalism]]  enables the  [[Individual]]  to readily grasp the laws of the Mental Universe, and to apply the same to his well-being and advancement. The Hermetic Student is enabled to apply intelligently the great Mental Laws, instead of using them in a haphazard manner. With the Master-Key in his possession, the student may unlock the many doors of the mental and  [[Psychic]]  temple of knowledge, and enter the same freely and intelligently. This Principle explains the true nature of "Energy," "Power," and "Matter," and why and how all these are  [[Hierarchy|subordinate]]  to the  [[_ARCHIVED/_ARCHIVED_Databases-Original/tana-skills/tana-slide-deck/SKILL|Mastery]]  of Mind. One of the old Hermetic Masters wrote, long ages ago: **"He who grasps the truth of the Mental Nature of the Universe is well advanced on The Path to Mastery."** And these words are as true today as at the time they were first written. Without this Master-Key, Mastery is impossible, and the student knocks in vain at the many doors of The Temple.

2.  The Principle of Correspondence

    "As above, so below; as below, so above."--The Kybalion.

This Principle embodies the truth that there is always a Correspondence between the laws and phenomena of the various planes of Being and Life. The old Hermetic axiom ran in these words: " [[As above, so below]] ; as below, so above." And the grasping of this Principle gives one the means of solving many a dark paradox, and hidden secret of Nature. There are planes beyond our knowing, but when we apply the Principle of Correspondence to them we are able to understand much that would otherwise be  [[Epistemology|unknowable]]  to us. This Principle is of universal application and manifestation, on the various planes of the  [[Materialism|material]] , mental, and spiritual universe--it is an Universal Law. The ancient Hermetists considered this Principle as one of the most important mental instruments by which man was able to pry aside the obstacles which hid from view the Unknown. Its use even tore aside the Veil of Isis to the extent that a glimpse of the face of the goddess might be caught. Just as a knowledge of the Principles of Geometry enables man to measure distant suns and their movements, while seated in his observatory, so a knowledge of the  [[Correspondence principle|Principle of Correspondence]]  enables Man to  [[Reason]]  intelligently from the Known to the Unknown.  Studying the monad, he understands the  [[Archangel]] .

3.  The Principle of Vibration

    "Nothing rests; everything moves; everything vibrates."--The Kybalion.

This Principle embodies the truth that "everything is in motion"; "everything vibrates"; "nothing is at rest"; facts which  [[History of science|Modern Science]]  endorses, and which each new scientific discovery tends to verify.  And yet this Hermetic Principle was enunciated thousands of years ago, by the Masters of  [[Ancient Egypt]] . This Principle explains that the differences between different manifestations of Matter, Energy, Mind, and even  [[Spirit (animating force)|Spirit]] , result largely from varying rates of Vibration. From THE ALL, which is  [[Basic research|Pure]]   [[Soul|Spirit]] , down to the grossest form of Matter, all is in vibration--the higher the vibration, the higher the  [[Position (geometry)|position]]  in the scale. The vibration of Spirit is at such an  [[Infinity|infinite]]  rate of intensity and rapidity that it is practically at rest--just as a rapidly moving wheel seems to be motionless. And at the other end of the scale, there are gross  [[Phase (matter)|forms of matter]]  whose vibrations are so low as to seem  [[Inertia|at rest]] . Between these poles, there are millions upon millions of varying degrees of vibration. From  [[Corpuscularianism|corpuscle]]  and  [[Electron]] ,  [[Atom]]  and  [[Molecule]] , to worlds and universes, everything is in vibratory motion. This is also true on the planes of energy and  [[Force]]  (which are but varying degrees of vibration); and also on the mental planes (whose states depend upon vibrations); and even on to the spiritual planes. An understanding of this Principle, with the appropriate formulas, enables Hermetic students to control their own mental vibrations as well as those of others. The Masters also apply this Principle to the conquering of Natural phenomena, in various ways. "He who understands the Principle of Vibration, has grasped the scepter of  [[Power (social and political)|power]] ," says one of the old writers.

4.  The Principle of Polarity

    "Everything is Dual; everything has poles; everything has its pair of opposites; like and unlike are the same; opposites are identical in nature, but different in degree; extremes meet; all truths are but half-truths; all paradoxes may be reconciled."--The Kybalion.

This Principle embodies the truth that "everything is dual"; "everything has two poles"; "everything has its pair of opposites," all of which were old Hermetic  [[Axiom|axioms]] . It explains the old  [[Paradox|paradoxes]] , that have perplexed so many, which have been stated as follows: "Thesis and  [[Antithesis]]  are  [[Identity (philosophy)|identical]]  in nature, but different in degree"; "opposites are the same, differing only in degree"; "the pairs of opposites may be reconciled"; " [[Extremes Meet]] "; "everything is and isn't, at the same time"; "all truths are but half-truths"; "every truth is half-false"; "there are two sides to everything," etc., etc., etc. It explains that in everything there are two poles, or opposite aspects, and that "opposites" are really only the two extremes of the same thing, with many varying degrees between them. To illustrate:  Heat and Cold, although "opposites," are really the same thing, the differences consisting merely of degrees of the same thing. Look at your  [[Thermometer]]  and see if you can discover where "heat" terminates and "cold" begins! There is no such thing as "absolute heat" or " [[Thermodynamic temperature|absolute]]  cold"--the two terms "heat" and "cold" simply indicate varying degrees of the same thing, and that "same thing" which manifests as "heat" and "cold" is merely a form, variety, and rate of  [[Vibration]] . So "heat" and "cold" are simply the "two poles" of that which we call " [[Heat]] "--and the  [[Phenomenon|phenomena]]  attendant thereupon are manifestations of the Principle of Polarity. The same Principle manifests in the case of "Light and Darkness," which are the same thing, the difference consisting of varying degrees between the two poles of the phenomena. Where does "darkness" leave off, and "light" begin? What is the difference between "Large and Small"? Between "Hard and Soft"? Between "Black and White"? Between "Sharp and Dull"? Between "Noise and Quiet"? Between "High and Low"? Between "Positive and Negative"? The Principle of Polarity explains these paradoxes, and no other Principle can supersede it. The same Principle operates on the  [[Mental plane]] . Let us take a radical and  [[Extremism|extreme]]  example--that of "Love and Hate," two mental states apparently totally different.  And yet there are degrees of Hate and degrees of Love, and a middle point in which we use the terms "Like or Dislike," which shade into each other so gradually that sometimes we are at a loss to know whether we "like" or "dislike" or "neither." And all are simply degrees of the same thing, as you will see if you will but think a moment.  And, more than this (and considered of more importance by the Hermetists), it is possible to change the vibrations of Hate to the vibrations of Love, in one's own mind, and in the minds of others. Many of you, who read these lines, have had personal experiences of the involuntary rapid transition from Love to Hate, and the reverse, in your own case and that of others.  And you will therefore realize the possibility of this being accomplished by the use of the Will, by means of the Hermetic formulas. " [[Good and evil]] " are but the poles of the same thing, and the Hermetist understands the art of transmuting Evil into Good, by means of an application of the Principle of Polarity. In short, the "Art of  [[Group polarization|Polarization]] " becomes a phase of "Mental Alchemy" known and practiced by the ancient and modern Hermetic Masters.  An understanding of the Principle will enable  [[Neoplatonism|one]]  to change his own  [[Astrological sign|Polarity]] , as well as that of  [[Other (philosophy)|others]] , if he will devote the  [[Time]]  and  [[Experiment|study]]  necessary to master the  [[Art]] .

5.  The Principle of Rhythm

    "Everything flows, out and in; everything has its tides; all things rise and fall; the pendulum-swing manifests in everything; the measure of the swing to the right is the measure of the swing to the left; rhythm compensates."--The Kybalion.

This Principle embodies the truth that in everything there is manifested a measured motion, to and fro; a flow and inflow; a swing backward and forward; a pendulum-like  [[Motion|movement]] ; a tide-like ebb and flow; a high-tide and  [[Tide|low-tide]] ; between the two  [[Geographical pole|poles]]  which exist in accordance with the Principle of  [[Magnet|Polarity]]  described a moment ago. There is always an action and a reaction; an advance and a retreat; a rising and a sinking. This is in the affairs of the  [[Universe]] , suns, worlds, men, animals, mind,  [[Energy]] , and  [[Matter]] .  This law is manifest in the creation and destruction of worlds; in the rise and  [[Revolutions of 1989|fall of nations]] ; in the life of all things; and finally in the  [[Mental state|mental states]]  of Man (and it is with this latter that the Hermetists find the understanding of the Principle most important). The Hermetists have grasped this Principle, finding its universal application, and have also discovered certain  [[Instrumental and intrinsic value|means]]  to overcome its effects  [[Thing-in-itself|in themselves]]  by the use of the appropriate formulas and methods. They apply the Mental Law of Neutralization. They cannot annul the Principle, or cause it to cease its operation, but they have learned how to escape its effects upon themselves to a certain degree depending upon the Mastery of the Principle.  They have learned how to USE it, instead of being USED BY it. In this and similar methods, consist the Art of the Hermetists. The Master of Hermetics polarizes himself at the point at which he desires to rest, and then neutralizes the Rhythmic swing of the pendulum which would tend to carry him to the other pole.  All individuals who have attained any degree of Self-Mastery do this to a certain degree, more or less unconsciously, but the Master does this consciously, and by the use of his Will, and attains a degree of Poise and Mental Firmness almost impossible of  [[Faith|belief]]  on the part of the masses who are swung backward and forward like a  [[Pendulum]] . This Principle and that of Polarity have been closely studied by the Hermetists, and the  [[Scientific method|methods]]  of counteracting, neutralizing, and USING them  [[Substantial form|form]]  an important part of the Hermetic Mental  [[Alchemy]] .

6.  The Principle of Cause and Effect

    "Every Cause has its Effect; every Effect has its Cause; everything happens according to Law; Chance is but a name for Law not recognized; there are many planes of causation, but nothing escapes the Law."--The Kybalion.

This Principle embodies the  [[Fact]]  that there is a Cause for every Effect; an Effect from every Cause. It explains that:  "Everything Happens according to Law"; that nothing ever "merely happens"; that there is no such thing as Chance; that while there are various planes of Cause and Effect, the higher dominating the  [[Social class|lower]]  planes, still nothing ever entirely escapes the Law. The Hermetists understand the art and  [[Methodology|methods]]  of rising above the ordinary plane of Cause and Effect, to a certain degree, and by mentally rising to a higher plane they become Causers instead of Effects. The masses of people are carried along, obedient to environment; the wills and desires of others stronger than themselves;  [[Heredity]] ; suggestion; and other outward causes moving them about like pawns on the Chessboard of  [[Life]] . But the Masters, rising to the plane above, dominate their moods, characters, qualities, and powers, as well as the environment surrounding them, and become Movers instead of pawns. They help to PLAY THE  [[Conway's Game of Life|GAME OF LIFE]] , instead of being played and moved about by other wills and environment. They USE the Principle instead of being its tools. The Masters obey the  [[Causality|Causation]]  of the higher planes, but they help to  [[Law|RULE]]  on their own plane. In this statement there is condensed a wealth of Hermetic  [[Knowledge]] --let him read who can.

7.  The Principle of Gender

    "Gender is in  [[Everything Everything|everything; everything]]  has its Masculine and Feminine Principles; Gender manifests on all planes."-- [[The Kybalion]] .

This Principle embodies the truth that there is GENDER manifested in everything--the  [[Masculinity|Masculine]]  and Feminine Principles ever at  [[Employment|work]] . This is  [[Truth|true]]  not only of the Physical Plane, but of the Mental and even the Spiritual Planes. On the  [[Physical plane]] , the Principle manifests as SEX, on the higher  [[Plane (esotericism)|planes]]  it takes higher  [[Theory of forms|forms]] , but the Principle is ever the same.  No creation, physical, mental or spiritual, is possible without this Principle. An  [[Understanding]]  of its laws will throw light on many a  [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]]  that has perplexed the minds of men. The Principle of Gender works ever in the direction of generation, regeneration, and creation.  [[Everything]] , and every  [[Human|person]] , contains the two Elements or Principles, or this great Principle, within it, him or her. Every Male  [[Object (philosophy)|thing]]  has the Female  [[Classical element|Element]]  also; every Female contains also the Male Principle.  If you would understand the  [[Philosophy]]  of  [[Mind|Mental]]  and  [[Spirituality|Spiritual]]   [[Creation myth|Creation]] ,  [[Generation]] , and  [[Religious education|Re]] -generation, you must understand and study this Hermetic Principle. It contains the  [[Problem solving|solution]]  of many mysteries of Life. We caution you that this Principle has no  [[Philosophy of language|reference]]  to the many base, pernicious and degrading lustful  [[Theory|theories]] , teachings and practices, which are taught under fanciful titles, and which are a prostitution of the great natural  [[Principle]]  of  [[Gender]] . Such base revivals of the  [[Classical antiquity|ancient]]  infamous forms of Phallicism tend to ruin mind, body and soul, and the Hermetic Philosophy has ever sounded the warning note against these degraded teachings which tend toward  [[Lust]] , licentiousness, and perversion of  [[Nature]] 's principles. If you seek such teachings, you must go elsewhere for them-- [[Hermeticism]]  contains nothing for you along these lines. To the pure, all things are pure; to the base, all things are base.
