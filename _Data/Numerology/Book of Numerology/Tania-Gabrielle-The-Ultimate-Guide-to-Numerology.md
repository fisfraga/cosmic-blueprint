## YOUR BIRTHDAY CODE {.h2t}

[O]{.dropcap}[N THE DAY YOU WERE BORN, YOU ACTIVATED A MAGNIFICENT BIRTH
CODE]{.f3}. This Birth Code is the blueprint to your soul, the
translation of your soul contract for this lifetime. Numerology, the
science of the meaning of numbers, is designed to translate the
Blueprint of your Soul to reveal your spiritual contract. This book will
give you the keys.

As you read, you will know when it resonates with you, because you'll
feel it at a soul level. You might sense a tingle down your spine or
experience delight and shivers of joy as you realize---your soul is
speaking to you through your own code!

Numbers are a gateway into developing your intuition. When you first
meet someone, you may have a gut feeling about him or her. Having access
to numbers gives you another perspective on their soul and permission to
confirm what you already []{#ch01.xhtml#page_11 .pagebreak}felt
intuitively. For example, look at the first letter of any person's first
name and you'll start understanding certain traits about who they are at
soul level (see [chapters 6](#ch06.xhtml#ch06) and
[11](#ch11.xhtml#ch11)).

Everything is energy. Everything carries a vibrational force. Every
number (and letter) is a unique vibration with a profound meaning. Just
as each musical note emits a unique frequency and sound (which can be
measured numerically), each number oscillates to a specific number of
cycles per second. Every sound, fragrance, color, and thought is a
vibration and can be measured as a number.

All the numbers aligned within one person (you), entity (business), or
family, create a code. Each sector of a code contributes to the whole
formula---a symphony of vibrant frequencies that make up all the
interconnections of your life.

This guide will reveal the mystery and magic in your codes, beginning
with the most important one, your Birth Code---the Blueprint of your
Soul. Just as importantly, this higher wisdom will give you a powerful
glimpse into other people's Soul Blueprints, thus helping you understand
them, forgive and love them unconditionally, and allow others the
freedom to find themselves in their own time and in their uniquely
designed way.

Numbers are the very essence of how life expresses itself. In
understanding your Birth Code you will discover who you truly are at
soul level, how to use your special gifts, and how you naturally
overcome obstacles to gain the wisdom and courage to fulfill your divine
mission.

Once you know and apply your Birth Code, you'll be freed from pursuing
expectations placed on you by others. What will set you free is getting
to know the True You through your Soul Blueprint. Knowing yourself
allows you to create your own reality---a reality based purely on your
alignment with spirit, rather than on unconscious motivations derived
from other people's advice and expectations.

Soul-code living begins at home---internally. You were indoctrinated to
believe certain things about yourself by external sources, and many, if
not most of those beliefs do not serve your highest good. Knowing your
Birth Code and how to apply it now and in the future will prepare and
strengthen you to manifest your true soul destiny.

When you are in alignment with your soul's Birth Code and current
cycles, you naturally align with abundance. Thus this book is designed
to elevate you to a place of joy, freedom, and a passionate
engagement---so you feel compelled to express your divine gifts at the
highest vibrational level! When you engage this way with the universe,
prosperity gravitates to you, abundance is attracted to you, and your
well-being translates into wealth of mind, body, and spirit.

[]{#ch01.xhtml#page_13 .pagebreak}Numerology---the gateway to
demystifying your Soul's DNA Code---helps you start a profound
relationship with yourself that facilitates a deep connection with what
delights you. Your soul code gives you "permission" to live a life of
fulfillment, joy, and emotional integrity. A journey that is purely
empowered by the soul is a celebration of abundance.

Each person is wired differently. Just like every snowflake carries a
unique imprint, so does every human being, every soul. Our numerology
Birth Code attests to that. Your soul's Birth Code reveals the unique
ways you are designed to experience, explore, and manifest fulfillment
and abundance. Everyone has an independent way of expressing joy!

By taking ownership of the divine gifts in your Birth Code, you start
making *conscious choices* that elevate your vibration higher and
higher...

Awareness of the code comes first. Action corresponding to your code
follows. Then positive breakthroughs automatically appear, especially
when you consistently set clear intentions that are congruent with your
code.

### THE THREE IMPORTANT NUMBERS IN YOUR BIRTH CODE {.h3}

You have many numbers in your birthday and birth-certificate name.
(Every letter translates as a number too, which we will discover in
[chapter 2](#ch02.xhtml#ch02).) However, there are three numbers that
impact you the most. Throughout this manual, they will be referred to as
the Three Important Numbers in your Birth Code.
:::

The first two important numbers that define your Birth Code are both
derived from your birthday. The third important number is derived from
your birth certificate name.

Your unique Birth Code is made up of:

1\. **Your Day of Birth Number**---the day of the month you were born

2\. **Your Life Purpose Number**---the total sum of your full birth date

3\. **Your Destiny Number**---the total sum of letters in your
birth-certificate name (see [chapter 2](#ch02.xhtml#ch02))

Combined into a powerful triad, your Birth Code is a spiritual and
practical formula that is totally unique to you. (Even identical twins
do not share the same Birth Code, due to their different birth names.)

Your Birth Code unlocks the secrets of your birth promise---special
gifts, talents, your personality, the nature of your mission, and
corresponding lessons. Each of your three individual personal
frequencies describes how you think, feel, act, and experience life.
Your Three Important Birth Numbers form the basic building blocks that
make up your divine DNA code.

[]{#ch01.xhtml#page_15 .pagebreak}You'll refer to the Three Important
Numbers in your Birth Code in every part of your life. In fact, they are
having an impact on you right now, whether you are aware of them or not!

Later in this guide you'll discover how to use your Birth Code to create
a personal forecast map. However, in order to unlock the fortunate
Personal Days, Months and Years (intensifications of your Birth Code),
you will need to know your Three Important Birth Numbers first.

Now let's discover the first two important numbers in your Birth Code:
your Day of Birth number and Life Purpose (full birthday) numbers. Both
are derived from your birthday. Let's begin with your Day of Birth
number---the easiest to calculate!

::: group
### YOUR DAY OF BIRTH NUMBER {.h3}

Every person and entity (like a business, book or product launch, live
event, ceremony, first meeting) is born on a specific day of the month.
The Day of Birth is one of Three Important Numbers in a person's Birth
Code.
:::

The Day of Birth number gives you instant insights into someone's
natural disposition, their way of being and tendencies, w ho they are
day-to-day, moment-to-moment---even if you do not know their age. This
allows you to do a quick reading on anyone, as long as you know they
were born on the 5th, 22nd, 17th, etc.---so, regardless of whether you
know their year of birth or not, you can read this part of their Birth
Code.

::: group
#### **WHAT IS YOUR DAY OF BIRTH NUMBER?** {.h4}

If you were born on the 1st through the 9th of any month, your Day of
Birth corresponds to that number. If you are born between the 10th and
the 31st of any month, you will be impacted by one additional
double-digit number (sometimes two) along with the single-digit or "root
number." Find the root number by adding together the digits of your Day
of Birth (twice, if the result is another double-digit number). Read the
descriptions in [chapters 4](#ch04.xhtml#ch04) and [5](#ch05.xhtml#ch05)
for your Day of Birth number and your root number(s).
:::

::: group
### YOUR LIFE PURPOSE NUMBER {.h3}

Every person and entity has a birthday. Adding all the digits in a given
birthday results in the Life Purpose Number, one of the Three Important
Numbers in your Birth Code. No one has just one number in their Birth
Code, but a combination of many.
:::

[]{#ch01.xhtml#page_16 .pagebreak}Your Life Purpose is a powerful
frequency revealing how you need to express your soul purpose. It
answers the following questions:

What is the main reason you are here? What is your main lesson? How are
you uniquely designed to feel happily engaged with your life? What
qualities will help you manifest the most success?

If you sense you're not on the right path, your Life Purpose number will
point you to your natural talents and abilities. You'll get a deep sense
of what makes you tick and understand why you are magnetically drawn to
certain activities, people, and goals.

Once you calculate your Life Purpose Number you'll hold the keys to your
unique purpose for being here on Earth in this lifetime. While there are
other people with whom you will share the same double-digit or
single-digit number, it is in combining all three birth numbers that
you'll get the overall big picture of who you are, what you're here to
do, and how you will best express your gifts.

::: group
#### **WHAT IS YOUR LIFE PURPOSE NUMBER?** {.h4}

The Life Purpose number is derived by adding each single-digit in a
person's full birthday. If that sum is two digits, it must then be
reduced (sometimes twice) to its single-digit "root" number. (Hint:
Anyone who is born in the 1900s will automatically have a two-digit Life
Purpose number). See [chapter 5](#ch05.xhtml#ch05) to discover the
meaning of all two-digit numbers (except "Master Numbers" 11, 22, 33,
and 44). See [chapter 3](#ch03.xhtml#ch03) to discover the meaning of
all nine single-digit numbers.

This person has a **25/7** Life Purpose number.

If a person's Life Purpose number (full birthday) adds up to **19**,
**28**, **29**, **37**, **38**, **39**, **46**, **47**, or **48**, then
you must add two times before you arrive at the single-digit root
number. Read the descriptions of all three numbers for the full picture.

Let's look at six studies. Case Studies 5 and 6 are examples of
birthdays that require two calculations and result in a Life Purpose
made up of three separate numbers.

### SHORT DESCRIPTIONS OF "ROOT NUMBERS" 1--9 {.h3}

Each single-digit number from 1 through 9 emits a unique vibration that
differentiates it from the other eight numbers, giving the person who
embodies it the strong characteristics and vital energy force of that
number. Knowing just the three important single-digit root numbers for
any person gives a powerful overall impression.

### THE REMAINING BIRTH CODE NUMBER {.h3}

You now know how to calculate two of your Three Important Birth Numbers,
powerful indicators of who you are at soul level. In fact, you can now
"get a read" on *anyone*---friends, family, and strangers---quickly once
they share their birthday with you. Just knowing a person's Day of Birth
gives you instant insights to help you tune in to their nature and
inclinations.
:::

While you can change your current name throughout your life, your
birthday and birth-certificate name are a permanent imprint of your soul
code that lasts for a lifetime. So, these Three Important Numbers in
your Birth Code never change.

Fortunately, as you will discover in [chapters
3](#ch03.xhtml#ch03)--[5](#ch05.xhtml#ch05), there is no such thing as a
positive or negative birth number. All Birth Code numbers are neutral,
all have a positive and shadow expression. It is up to you to choose the
positive expression of each number in your Birth Code. This is your key
to staying in alignment with your purpose and mission.

Now let's discover the magic in your Birth Name---the final of your
three important birth numbers!

[]{#ch02.xhtml}

## []{#ch02.xhtml#page_22 .pagebreak}[CHAPTER 2]{.f3} {#ch02.xhtml#ch02 .h2n}

## YOUR BIRTH-NAME CODE {.h2t}

[W]{.dropcap}[HEN YOU WERE BORN, IN ADDITION TO THE CODE IN YOUR
BIRTHDAY, YOU WERE GIVEN ANOTHER UNIQUE CODE]{.f3}---it is your Destiny
Number, derived from the name on your birth certificate. This is the
third of your three core birth numbers. Your Destiny Number describes
the nature of your work environment, specifically *how* you naturally
use your gifts and activate your divine mission. Thus your Destiny
Number is aligned with your career.

[]{#ch02.xhtml#page_23 .pagebreak}You are designed to express your Day
of Birth Number and Life Purpose Number in a certain way. This "way" is
your career environment, described by your Destiny Number.

For example, if your Day or Life Purpose Number resonates to the root
number 3, then you must share joy and uplift others in some capacity.
The key to *how* to turn this natural way of being into a thriving
career is described by your Destiny Number. If your Destiny Number
resonates to the root number 7, then your best career environment for
expressing joy and uplifting others happens when you are working alone,
in private, with plenty of time to think, read, and listen. Ideally you
have easy access to nature, since 7 is the number of serenity,
contemplation, analysis, and inspiration. Your breakthroughs come in
moments of silence. Your natural optimism and desire for self-expression
(3 Life Purpose or Day of Birth) are unlocked when you are in your own
private quiet space, where timelessness exists and your mind can enter a
kind of cathartics state of being. . .

On the other hand, if you have a **3** Day of Birth or Life Purpose and
a Destiny Number that reduces to **8**, then you are meant to step up as
a leader who inspires and motivates others from a joyful place, or you
embody the connection between happiness and financial abundance, or you
elevate others to lead from an internal place of joyful self expression,
often through entrepreneurship.

Do this exercise with both your Day of Birth Number and Life Purpose
Number---merge each of them with your Destiny Number to discover how you
to best express your gifts, personality and strengths in a career
environment.

Let's begin by calculating your birth certificate name first. It's best
to learn how to add all the letters in your name before using an online
calculator so you can write down and feel your numbers in action!

::: group
### HOW TO CALCULATE YOUR DESTINY NUMBER {.h3}

Every person and entity (business name, book title, or product name) has
a name. The "birth name" is the third of Three Important Numbers in your
Birth Code. To calculate your birth name, please use the name on your
birth certificate.
:::

If you were adopted, please use the birth-certificate name that was in
place before you turned six months old. So, if the new adopted name was
made official before you were six months of age, use that name. If it
was changed after you turned six months old, use the original
birth-certificate name as the primary Destiny Number. You can still look
at the new adopted name as a secondary influence, but it will not be
used as one of the Three Important Numbers in your Birth Code.

[]{#ch02.xhtml#page_24 .pagebreak}Each letter resonates to a specific
number. When calculating which number is aligned with which letter, we
use the Pythagorean (Western) Numerology Alphabet system. It is a
straight forward system where the letter A corresponds to the number 1,
B to number 2, C to number 3 all the way to I to number 9. It and then
begins at letter J for number 1 and so on.

Use the following table to convert every individual letter in each of
the names that make up your full birth certificate name into a number:

[PYTHAGOREAN SYSTEM]{.f3}

::: land100
![Image](./f0024-01.jpg){#f0024-01}
:::

Add up your birth-certificate name to discover your Destiny Number:

1\. Write the birth name down on a piece of paper (or type the birth
name on your computer).

2\. Assign each letter to the corresponding number in the alphabet,
using the Pythagorean System above.

3\. Count all the numbers for one total.

Your total Destiny Number then must be reduced to a single-digit root
number. As you discovered in [chapter 1](#ch01.xhtml#ch01), sometimes
you need to reduce more than once to arrive at that single-digit.

Important tips on suffixes in birth names:

1\. Do not count the letters in "Jr" or "Sr." For example, "John Smith,
Jr." is written as "JOHN SMITH" without "Jr."

2\. Do not count I, II, or III. For example, "John Smith, III" is
calculated as "JOHN SMITH."

3\. Count any foreign letters as if they did not have symbols---so å is
a, ü is u, Æ is AE, œ is oe, and so on.

Let's look at the same six celebrity case studies from [chapter
1](#ch01.xhtml#ch01) to learn how to calculate any Destiny Number from
all the letters in a person's birth-certificate name.

[]{#ch02.xhtml#page_25 .pagebreak}After calculating each Destiny Number,
you will see each case study's Three Important Birth Numbers---their Day
of Birth, Life Purpose and Destiny Numbers. Then you'll see a summary
showing how to merge the Day of Birth and Life Purpose number meaning
with the Destiny Number meaning. This summary gives you six examples on
*how* in combination the Three Important Birth Numbers point to the
career environment best suited for each celebrity example. You will see
how each one is expressing their gifts in alignment with the Three
Important Numbers in their Birth Code.

1\. Day of Birth: **31/4**

2\. Life Purpose Number: **24/6**

3\. Destiny Number **98/17/8**

First look up the meanings for single-digit **Day of Birth** and **Life
Purpose Numbers 4** and **6** in [chapter 1](#ch01.xhtml#ch01). Given
those meanings you'll notice that Justin is naturally very methodical
(4) and magnetic (6); disciplined, productive, grounded (4); creative,
responsible, compassionate (6); as well as not being afraid of work and
making his own rules (4) and craving harmony and being fond of luxury

Justin Timberlake's 4 Day of Birth and 6 Life Purpose Numbers with his 8

First look up the meanings for single-digit **Day of Birth** and **Life
Purpose Numbers 1** and **7** in [chapter 1](#ch01.xhtml#ch01). Given
those meanings you'll notice that Julia is a natural and authentic
leader, an original thinker with unique ideas (1), seeks solutions in a
quiet way (7), is strong willed and determined (1) while having an air
of mystery and wisdom (7), has definite views and a strong independent
streak (1), is a natural truth seeker who []{#ch02.xhtml#page_28
.pagebreak}craves alone time, is extremely private, and needs to be in
touch with nature on a regular basis.

How does she express these gifts in a career environment? Through her
**Destiny Number 6---**look up the meaning for number 6 in [chapter
1](#ch01.xhtml#ch01). Julia Roberts is artistic, compassionate, very
magnetic, refined, and is creative; she needs natural harmondy, is a
natural nurturer, loves to be of service in some way, is dedicated to
her family and a beautiful home environment.

Now let's *combine* the meaning of Julia Roberts's 1 Day of Birth and 7
Life Purpose numbers with her 6 **Destiny Number** to see the best
career environment for her:

When Julia Roberts is in a positive vibrational state, the career
environment that allows her to express her natural gifts with greatest
ease and joy is defined by Julia using her magnetic presence as an
Artist or Healer to be of service from a place of Love and compassion,
dedicated to being a Creator of beauty from a place of honesty and
integrity. She has an independent perspective of her divine mission and
yearns for unique projects to work to satisfy her quest for wisdom and
knowledge and her dedication to be of Service.

Julia's leading lady status in Hollywood--her magnetic, beautiful, and
compassionate presence on the screen---is coupled with a deep personal
need to "get away from the hustle and bustle," devote quality time to
her family, and replenish her soul's core need for privacy in nature
ultimately defines her purpose and destiny.

## SINGLE-DIGITS 1--9 AND THE THREE TRIADS {.h2t}

[N]{.dropcap}[OW IT'S TIME TO DELVE INTO THE POSITIVE GIFTS AND SHADOW
SIDE FOR ALL NINE SINGLE-DIGIT ROOT NUMBERS.]{.f3} You are both
supported and enlightened by your beautiful soul code. Each of our Three
Important Birth Numbers will illuminate moments that shift us (both
challenging and exciting!) so that we can acclimate and make the most
out of them!

Root numbers by their very name define the underlying energy of any
number when it is reduced to its origin---a single-digit. Please refer
to [chapter 4](#ch04.xhtml#ch04) for all double-digit "Master Numbers"
11, 22, 33, 44, etc. and [chapter 5](#ch05.xhtml#ch05) for all
double-digit "compound" numbers (10--99).

[]{#ch03.xhtml#page_37 .pagebreak}Each single-digit number can be
compared to the key of a piece of music, such as A minor or D major,
from which the building blocks of melody and harmony are formed. Numbers
are aligned to music and to the stars---they form a code that is both
visible and invisible. This chapter will unveil the deep mysteries of
each single-digit and forms the basis of the whole book itself.

It's important to note that most people have at least two different root
numbers in their Three Important Birth Numbers' code. Only on rare
occasions will you meet someone who has the same three root numbers as
their Day of Birth, Life Purpose, and Destiny Number.

If one of your three numbers appears twice (for example, you have a 7
Day of Birth and a 124 Destiny which reduces to 7) then you have an
"Intensification." Refer to [chapter 11](#ch11.xhtml#ch11) for more on
intensifications, both in your Birth Code and other areas of your life.

We begin with the three numerology triads, since they reveal how each
single-digit belongs to a unique number "family."

::: group
### THE 1-5-7 "MIND" TRIAD {.h3}

The three numbers that compose the Mind Triad are 1, 5, and 7. Those who
have one or more of these three Mind numbers are analytical,
intellectual, intuitive, ambitious, independent, witty, and psychic.
This Mind Triad is comfortable with information, both analyzing and
gathering facts and figures and using the mind to solve problems and
make decisions. They enjoy learning and exploring new territory.
:::

Mind Triad people may have a tendency to worry or overanalyze---getting
caught up in the net of information overload. Encouraging a Mind person
to feel the outcome of their solutions in advance instead of thinking
through them may make them feel a tad uncomfortable---but is truly the
way into experiencing that missing link---the blissful factor.
Fortunately, Mind people have a natural intuitive side that is always
ready to listen once they switch off (or at least turn down) their
"inner analyst!"

::: group
### THE 2-4-8 "MANIFESTATION" TRIAD {.h3}

The three numbers that comprise the Manifestation Triad are 2, 4, and 6.
Those who have one or more of these three Manifestation numbers are by
nature more patient, have a peaceful, grounding energy, use order and
discipline to manifest results into physical reality, and are a stable
influence. Manifestation Triad people know how to get things done and
overcome obstacles to do so. Thus having a 2, 4 or 8 in your Three
Important Birth []{#ch03.xhtml#page_38 .pagebreak}Numbers is an
invitation to implement result after result, building a solid foundation
for now and the future.
:::

Manifestation people may have a tendency to implement before intuiting
or feeling out the efficacy of their plans. So they may be perplexed
when they don't achieve their intended result. This happens because
their intentions were not fully aligned with how they feel before they
go into manifestation mode. Taking the "heart" and "fun" out of the
intention process can lead to frustration. With their natural thirst to
manifest, they just need to carve out some quality time to enjoy the
process, introduce a sense of *play*, and check into their feelings.
Then, the outcomes of their steady implementation process will be
extraordinary and lasting.

::: group
### THE 3-6-9 "CREATION" TRIAD {.h3}

Numbers 3, 6, and 9 form the Triad of Creation. Those people who have
one or more of these three Creation numbers are by nature compassionate,
loving, emotionally engaged, highly creative, nurturing, enthusiastic,
and social and have a great need to be of service in order to uplift
others. Creation Triad people must have their heart engaged in every
part of their life experience. Feeling good and expressing their good
vibes in some way is their key to happiness. Thus they must have an
outlet to talk, write, dance---create in any format of their choosing.
:::

When expressing the shadow side of this triad, the person can get moody,
dissipate energy through distractions, stop manifesting altogether and
abdicate responsibilities. They can feel sorry for themselves and blame
the world for what they perceive as unfair treatment. The best "cure"
for distractions and doldrums is---to go play and create. Laughter and
humor are wonderful healing balms for the 3-6-9 triad to create a
"pattern interrupt" and press the mood reset button! Their feelings are
their soul-food, and so getting into a positive state allows them to
feel valued, appreciated, and loved again. Then they can share the love,
uplift others, and thrive. After all, to *love* is their ultimate
motivation.

A special note about this triad. The 3-6-9 triad governs the creation
process. Thus the building blocks of the universe reduce down to these
three numbers. In astrology, for example, all the different "aspects"
(connections between planets or angles) add up to numbers that reduce to
either 3, 6, or 9, such as the 120-degree "Trine," which adds up to 3;
the 90-degree "Square," which adds up to 9 and the 60-degree "Sextile,"
which adds up to 6 (Any aspect will reduce to 3, 6, or 9.) The 24 hours
in a day add up to 6, and 12 hours add up to 3. 60 minutes is 6.

[]{#ch03.xhtml#page_39 .pagebreak}Multiples of 3, 6, and 9 are repeated
over and over again no matter which number is multiplied.

Use the three triads---Mind, Manifestation and Creation---to get a quick
read on anyone. For example, if you know a person with a 10/**1** Day of
Birth (which is in the Mind Triad) and a 33/**6** Life Purpose (which is
in the Creation Triad), you can deduce that this person likes to analyze
and think things through, craves independence, is motivated (Mind), has
a great capacity for compassion, enjoys helping and advising others, has
good people skills, and must express their feelings (Creation).

These three numerology triads alone are a great starting point to gain
instant understanding of a person's outlook and natural ways.

::: group
### NUMBER "0" {.h3}

The number 0 hovers between worlds---between numbers of positive value
and numbers of negative value, between the seen and the unseen. It
therefore represents a unique power. In fact, if you add 0 to any number
*it expands and empowers that number*---3 becomes 30, 7 magnifies to
70---and the more zeros you add, the bigger the value becomes---2,000
and 8,000,000---carry far more impact and influence than 2 and 8.
:::

Thus the number 0 represents the "God Number," symbolizing the greatest
power and multidimensional reality---the supreme balance between light
and dark. 0 is the full circle, representing all the universes,
galaxies, multiverses---all there was, is, and will be to experience.
When you loose track of time, you experience the power of hovering
between worlds in a space where life just is---and each moment expands
into timelessness.

0 takes you to your Origins---Original Source, where there is and always
will be Only light, total Omnipotence. Even the word "zero" ends with
the letter O, representing 0. The full circle in O is both everything
and nothing, full and empty. It is both a container and an entry into
another dimension. It can hold all energy, while allowing all energy to
pass through it. There is no time, just eternity.

Look at zero as the ultimate existential experience. Zero puts a divine
sparkle into everything it touches. Zero holds divine light.

### MEANING OF SINGLE-DIGIT "ROOT" NUMBERS {.h3}

Let's go now on a wonderful, life-changing journey and discover the
secret drivers, divine gifts, and direction for all nine single-digit
numbers from 1 through 9.
:::

:::

[]{#ch03.xhtml#page_41 .pagebreak}Use the following descriptions for
your Day of Birth Number, Life Purpose Number, and Destiny Number.

Make a note of intensifications---when the same number repeats. (See
[chapter 11](#ch11.xhtml#ch11))

Pay attention to which numerology triad your Three Important Birth
Numbers belong to:

Are they **all grouped into one triad family?** For example, all three
of your Important Birth Code numbers are either 2, 4, or 8 thus
representing the Manifestion Triad exclusively. Or do they represent
**two** of three triads? For example, your Birth Code comprises a 3 and
a 9 (Creation) plus 5 (Mind). Or do your Three Important Birth Code
Numbers **all belong to different triads?** For example, a 3 Day of
Birth (Creation Triad), a 2 Life Purpose (Manifestation Triad), and a 7
Destiny (Mind Triad).

::: group
#### **ROOT NUMBER 1** {.h4}

1 is the number of new beginnings and originality. It is the vibration
of free will, individual pursuit, innovation, and daring---the original
spark of creation. 1 represents courage, and enthusiasm. 1 people
following their primary impulse. They are natural born leaders who want
to leave a unique legacy. They resist taking the beaten path, instead
follow their instinct to create new experiences for others---introducing
innovative new ways---by following their own, individual path. When in
positive alignment, a 1 person animates energy, stays in motion, always
creating something new, and guides others to break through into new
territory by the very nature of who they are at soul level. They rebel
against being asked to follow others, since it is their role to take
command.
:::

1 is the first number in the Mind Triad, and so this vibration means the
mind is always on fire with ideas springing up freely and uninhibited,
always with the intent to create something new. Putting the ideas into
practice takes its form in unique ways. 1 feels like they are "number
one," seeking to stand out in some way and direct others, or be the
"star." They usually become important and influential in some area of
life.

Mediocrity frustrates a 1 person---they need to feel value and the
original, intelligent spark of creation in everything and everyone.
Confidence and fearlessness are their natural gifts (a lack of these
qualities means they are out of alignment energetically).

[]{#ch03.xhtml#page_42 .pagebreak}1

The image of the one is of a straight line coming from heaven to earth
and back. It is dignified and straightforward, and has a penetrating
sense of direction. 1 is a vibration that represents the masculine
aspect of our human experience.

All number 1 people carry dignity. 1 likes to stand out, is proud,
achievement oriented, represents the primal impulse, and has a strong
self-worth. 1 always will demand respect and feels set apart from
others. 1 has strong views and definite beliefs, and protects those that
are vulnerable. They are private, value their solitude, and enjoy
spending time alone.

1s are very affectionate with those whom they love and trust but not
keen on having an immediate familiarity with people they have just met.
1 is comfortable around younger people and children, though they may at
times feel a sadness arise from childhood memories. 1 enjoys exquisite
clothes and jewelry and tends to have impeccable taste with a penchant
for the finer things in life.

Since 1s are naturally self-centric and here to learn to be
self-sufficient and self-reliant, they also have a great desire to be in
love and be loved by a partner. This paradox exists perhaps because they
need to explore first being independent and then reach out and learn to
be *interdependent*. Of all the nine numbers, 1 people may know best how
to bypass codependency due to their underlying need for self-reliance.

1 is in the Mind Triad, thus blessing 1 people with mental resources and
an active imagination. Appealing to a 1 person's intelligence leads to
the best results. This is true for children and adolescents as well. 1s
do not do well with authority and control, and they will eventually
rebel and even turn aggressive. 1s need to guard against overanalyzing
and worrying about a future that is totally hypothetical. Staying
focused on the present in a flowing, creative state of being allows 1
people to thrive and reach their highest goals, often with astounding
speed.

1 must feel like they are an authority in something. They are natural
leaders and use their original ideas to move energy with dynamic power.

::: group
#### **CHALLENGING EXPRESSIONS:** {.h4}

1 people are very good at starting but have a more difficult time
completing projects and goals. Their pride can get the best of
them---they can even go against their true values when their pride is
wounded. 1 does not respond well to criticism, though they can dish it
out. 1 in its shadow expression is stubborn, will complain when
ambitions are thwarted and can be quite self-centered. 1 can suffer from
"bruised ego" syndrome and will only help others if they do exactly as
the 1 person expects of them. When a 1 is ignored, they can lash out
with anger.
:::

[]{#ch03.xhtml#page_43 .pagebreak}When out of alignment, a 1 person can
be boastful, aggressive, cynical, and egotistical, and even can turn to
bullying others to create a false sense of power. Their repressed
feelings can turn to anger, and they are unwilling to join forces with
others or cooperate with people easily, preferring their own way or the
highway. They won't want to be told what to do and may even lash out
aggressively to stop anyone whom they view as an unwelcome parental
figure.

Other out-of-alignment expressions for number 1 are lacking iniative or
being indecisive, lazy, low in confidence, or easily influenced and
swayed by others.

If you have hurt a 1 person in some way and want to come back into
harmony with them, share your sentiments with great humility---a 1 won't
necessarily wrap their arms around you, but will accept your apology
with grace and gratitude.

1 people believe they are superior to others and can attract resentment
for these airs of superiority, since they can come off as pedantic,
arrogant, and conceited. Thus they can be obstinate and do not accept
opposition in any way, shape, or form. Or they can be inconsiderate of
other people's feelings even while they themselves are very sensitive.

The way to harmony and peace is to be carefree and spontaneous, loosen
the reins of control, use their good humor, and tap into their love of
new discoveries, as this positive mindset instantly presses the reset
button, aligns 1s to their heart-center, and lets bygones be bygones.

Affirmation: *I am at one with my mind, heart and soul. I magically
create miraculous opportunities for me to accomplish anything!*

::: group
#### **ROOT NUMBER 2** {.h4}

2 is the number of peace, balance, and unity---the union of opposites.
With a strong emphasis on balance, 2 is designed to merge realities,
bringing opposites together. 2s are the peacemakers, mediators, and
diplomats---wanting harmony to prevail even under the most trying
conditions. Thus their patience and listening abilities are highly
prized.
:::

2 carries ancient wisdom, and a sense of mysticism and secrets and has
wonderful artistic gifts. It represents duality, pairs, couples, the
feminine vibration, receptivity, and one-on-one engagement. 2 people are
very sensitive, so be extra gentle with them. 2 is connected to
imagination and dreams. They love to connect to and correspond with
others.

[]{#ch03.xhtml#page_44 .pagebreak}As the most diplomatic of all nine
numbers, 2 people get along with pretty much anyone. This is especially
true since 2s don't seek to measure up against others at the cost of
harmony and maintaining equilibrium. They don't feel the need to impose
their views or beliefs on others. They are also peaceful people to be
around, since they exude a calmness when making decisions.

2

The visible representation of number 2 looks like a person bowing to the
left, in the direction of the number 1. This innate desire to merge with
another, join with them, and create peace is integral to all 2s.

2s have a need to look for advice, support, and approval from
others---making sure all bases are covered before they break new ground.
This cautious approach requires a need to understand and know as much as
they can before making a decision and then proceeding with care. This
moderate approach is appreciated and respected by others, giving 2s the
gift of good judgment.

This, coupled with their kind disposition, warmth, and understanding
makes them easy to be with and welcome in any situation. 2s are
excellent managers, as they have a miraculous touch of persuasion which
opens doors for everyone to see eye to eye---often discreetly getting
others to view things their way. This tact, mediation, and diplomacy
enables the 2 person to make major inroads in securing consensus between
different parties, allowing them to open doors and succeed where others
could not.

2 is the first vibration in the 2-4-8 Manifestation Triad. Thus 2s are
naturally responsible, conscientious, and efficient. 2s are usually
humble, but can initially lack self-confidence.

2 people are very psychic, though they may keep that side of themselves
secret. They are extremely sensitive to other people's feelings, sensing
them instantly, and so they are very concerned for their close loved
ones' well-being. Their highly developed intuition serves them well when
they meet people, since their natural shyness can lead them to not trust
others easily. 2s are generous friends and make great companions. They
have a natural interest in the psychology of human nature due to their
acute observation skills and ability to intuit body language, sounds,
and facial expressions. This makes them excellent observers.

2s are naturally very romantic, stemming from the number's connection to
two people in partnership. One of their main lessons is to be in
partnership with lovers, friends, and associates without losing their
independence and sense of self. Not falling into codependent
relationship patterns is a major lesson for any 2 person. 2s are very
affectionate and tender. They have a primal urge to please others.

[]{#ch03.xhtml#page_45 .pagebreak}Due to their sensitive nature 2 people
are secretive and don't readily share their intimate thoughts, their
plans, or even what their next move will be. At the same time they are
wonderful conversationalists and can naturally get others to reveal
parts of themselves. When they approach their goals, they are the
opposite of 1 people, who just go for it---2s will move forward, then
course-correct and then might head right, left, and even backwards
before lunging forward again, often with great force. This zigzag
pattern towards their goals gives them a sense of balance, which they so
crave. A 2 person will usually attract financial well-being---if
anything, it is rare to see them struggling in conditions of poverty.
However, if trained to have a "poverty-conscious" mindset, 2s must
consciously extricate themselves from this paradigm first before
experiencing their natural gift to attract prosperity. 2s are very
giving with their resources. They find it more difficult to accept
gifts, having an innate tendency to feel inadequate if they accept
support, especially financial.

2s trust others implicitly. They can't imagine anyone having a "bad"
intention or being anything but kind and noble. This means they believe
what others tell them. So they must learn to discern between what feels
right and what feels just a little "off"---use their intuitive gifts to
separate the manipulators from those who will not take advantage of
their kind hearts and good faith.

A 2 person loves to dream and live in their imaginary, idealistic world.
These sensitive, kind souls are highly adaptable and intuitive, giving
them all the qualities they need to fulfill their beautiful dream of
bringing peace, love, and harmony to the world. In their most positive
state, 2s are a true blessing to everyone around them.

::: group
#### **Challenging expressions:** {.h4}

A 2 person living in the shadow expression of their number may have a
tendency to fear the unknown and be unusually cautious. They need highly
sensitive support to come to terms with the unfamiliar. In fact, 2s can
fear every kind of pain or loss, allowing their very active imagination
to fuel their fears and worries. They may appear calm and balanced, but
this can also hide a neurotic, touchy, nervous disposition. If they feel
hurt by someone, they don't tend to react aggressively; rather they will
retreat into silence and even shut down.
:::

Due to their natural humility, 2s, when out of alignment, can sometimes
slip into feeling inadequate and suffer from low self-esteem. This sets
up a situation where they can easily get depressed and in turn will
create problems for themselves to almost "prove" their perceived state
of lack. []{#ch03.xhtml#page_46 .pagebreak}The 2-4-8 Manifestation Triad
that number 2 belongs to is very meticulous and demands thorough
attention to detail---but the sensitive 2 person can go overboard and
demand too much of themselves. Expectations that are set too high can
spiral into complexes and inhibited behavior, as they doubt their own
abilities and react fearfully when the unexpected shows up at their
doorstep. This self-criticism is a big lesson for the 2 to overcome, so
they stay centered and live their life free of inner conflict.

Being in a secure, loving home base is integral for their equilibrium
across all of the spectrums in their life. If they feel obligated to
live in a disharmonious and tense environment, or with people who are
argumentative and aggressive, they will loose their sense of
equilibrium. This is when 2s can become bitter and broken. Since
conflict and a disharmonious environment have a very detrimental effect
on 2s, they must always have a "safe place" to go to in order to feel
loved and nurtured; otherwise they will lash out and be temperamental.
Loud noise, aggressive, violent movies and blasting music will also harm
the energetic field around a 2 person and can easily throw them off
balance.

At the same time, 2s will sacrifice much to get their life back into
harmony. It is very important for all 2s to accept that life is filled
with both positive and negative situations so that they don't react to
the challenging moments with tension, depression, and inner turmoil.
This is why having a harmonious home environment is so integral to their
spiritual, mental, and emotional health.

Their shyness may make them "freeze" around strangers. Once they feel
their heart engaged in a conversation (and sense that there is no danger
of being hurt), they open up the soft petals of their sweet, tender
heart to others. They are deeply affected by inconsiderate or rude
behavior. However, once they regain their balance they will figure out
how to justify such actions by others and forgive them.

2s can be very cautious and may not easily take a chance. They also can
become possessive of things and people. Indecision can lead to feeling
separate and divided.

To remain balanced and strengthen their inner confidence, 2s must
release their desire to please and be "perfect;" otherwise doubt and
indecision will run their lives in circles. Their need to please can
lead them to sacrifice their own unique ideas for someone else's
cause---thus 2s need to be diligent and maintain boundaries.

They must not get preoccupied with unimportant matters---like surfing
the internet and obsessive attention to social media---which create a
false sense of connection the 2 craves *without yielding meaningful
results*, and the end result is that the wasted time reinforces a sense
of inadequacy and []{#ch03.xhtml#page_47 .pagebreak}incompletion. 2s
must always discern between what actually matters and what does not. . .
what is for their highest good, and what is not.

Getting to this place of peace means learning first and foremost how to
Relax. Relaxation is the key for a 2 to regain and maintain inner
harmony and peace. In this place of serenity their moods and emotions
won't get repressed or overwhelm them---both sure signs that they are
imbalanced and just need to take a moment to regroup. Deep breathing,
exercise, and meditation are wonderful and necessary on a daily basis
for all 2s. Bypass division, separation, or indecision through
listening, deep breathing, and gratitude.

Affirmation: *I am indivisible. I breathe deeply and feel connected to
the divine at all times. I am grateful for every experience that comes
my way and see hidden benefits to each encounter in my life*.

::: group
#### **ROOT NUMBER 3** {.h4}

A 3 person is highly creative, action oriented, and truthful and
radiates with joy. They are fluid in how they move through their life
experiences, and love to explore everything from their heart-center. 3
is connected to truth, fertility and creation. It is the number
representing the trinity of Mother-Father-Child. This trinity governs
creation---which is the numbers 1 (primal impulse) and 2 (desire for
peace) propelled into action. 3 people are usually very talented, very
vivacious, interested in many things, ingenious and brilliant. They are
curious and love to learn---asking questions all the time.
:::

3 is the first number in the Creation Triad and thus is fiercely
independent, seeking total freedom of movement. 3s have the artistic
touch even if they are not in the arts. This number requires that they
express themselves in some capacity, either through writing, speaking,
performing as a musician, dancer, or actor, being the star of a radio or
TV show or having a platform of some kind to share their message. 3s,
above anything, must communicate. They always have something to say!
They are fierce advocates of freedom of speech and expression. Their
natural yearning for renewal and birth gives them tremendous powers of
creation.

The 3-6-9 Creation Triad that number 3 belongs to infuses them with
compassion, tenderness, and a loving, affectionate disposition. They are
magnetic, and their smile lights up any room. 3s are impressionable and
can be easily influenced. This is especially true if others appeal to
their giving []{#ch03.xhtml#page_48 .pagebreak}and generous nature---or
show them appreciation so they feel valued and appreciated.

3 people have a great sense of humor and a cheerful disposition. Their
optimism is contagious, and they tend to see the world with the glass
half full---searching for the bright side of everything and in everyone.
When energetically aligned with their gifts, 3s are the most positive,
uplifting people to be around. No other vibration gives such light,
grace and is as enchanting!

3s can take any challenging situation and move quickly through
bitterness (or bypass it altogether) into a place of acceptance and
seeing it in a positive light. Their ability to "see" future positive
impact and outcomes for any current or past challenge stems from an
uncanny "bird's-eye" view 3s have, which allows them to fully move
through pain and trauma and come out the other side seemingly whole and
reborn. Thus their ability to reboot---literally *create* their
reality---as well as acknowledge the bright side in everything and
everyone, is one of their most powerful gifts. These talents, coupled
with their natural gifts of expression and outgoing personalities, make
3s adept at helping anyone feel good, whether it is an intimate friend
needing their support, or in brand new social situations. They are
experts at comfortably mixing with any group and have a knack for
adjusting quickly to different personalities or changing situations.

3

The image of the 3 is two wide-open half circles facing to the left,
gathering inspiration form the past and remolding it to manifest a new
creation. It has a welcoming feeling to it, and thus the embracing,
congenial nature of the 3 person---wrapping their two arms around
everyone they meet---is represented by the figure 3.

3s are born to inspire. They cast a spell by just being delightful,
motivating others to act through their passionate enthusiasm, happiness,
positive mindset, and optimistic attitude. Their spontaneity blends with
an effortless capacity to connect with anyone---be it in an elevator for
10 seconds or in any other social setting. Their natural charm, coupled
with their brilliant and personable magnetism, relaxes and "disarms"
anyone with whom they make contact.

For 3s everything comes down to furthering a deep ideal, something they
are so passionate about that they can't imagine anyone else not sharing
the same ideal with them. This ideal is their truth, and 3s, adherence
to what is true is one of their major drivers. They will leave no stone
unturned to find the truth. Thus they make great detectives. If you
answer a 3 in an evasive way, they'll not let you get away with it! 3s
can spot a lie []{#ch03.xhtml#page_49 .pagebreak}in a second. Even if
they are somehow heading down a misleading path, they will never stop
trying to search for the truth.

3s are not as driven to be successful in order to achieve a high
position or power in as much as they appreciate success due to the
pleasures and good life that achievement brings. 3s love a deliciously
prepared meal as much as beautiful surroundings and adornments. They
like to spoil themselves and their loved ones (and need to watch their
wallets).

3s thrive when they can travel. . . being with others, seeing the world,
and going on journeys wakes up their innate creativity and yearning for
independence. Plus they love to explore other countries, cultures,
music, and people---getting to know other ideas, religions, lifestyles,
and cultural paradigms. 3s are also deeply spiritual because 3 aligns
with their quest for truth.

3s love defending the underdog and are advocates for animals. They will
take risks---and when they couple their natural passion with their
willingness to take a chance, their impact is beautiful and great. Their
delightful, charming, magnetic personalities are a breath of fresh air
invoking a lightness of being.

Having a higher education is important for 3s and makes them feel part
of the higher ideals and philosophies they so cherish. They must have a
total sense of independence in any marriage union in order to feel the
freedom that is integral to their happiness. 3s appreciate and enjoy
luxury, which reflects the beauty and vibrant nature of their soul.

A balanced 3 will not succumb to moodiness or depression and will easily
forgive themselves as well as forgiving others. Having a good circle of
friends can help 3s to express their ideas and feelings, though the key
to their happiness is to engage in creative activities that totally
absorb them.

The key to a happy, meaningful life is for a 3 to *focus and
specialize*.

3 people must *persevere in their chosen specialty* and not get offtrack
and distracted by frivolous activities. They must only promise what they
can deliver and intend to accomplish.

When 3s know they are uplifting people, nothing will stop them. In their
natural, connected state, 3 people are luminous, vibrant beings of joy.

::: group
#### **Challenging expressions:** {.h4}

3s can and will multitask; however, their tendency to scatter and go
offtrack results in wasted energies when they are tired or out of
alignment. They can delay or dilute the impact of their divine mission
if they don't learn to how to focus and specialize in one direction at a
time. Vacillation can lead to indecision or going on tangents for hours,
days, or weeks at a time. 3s []{#ch03.xhtml#page_50 .pagebreak}like to
begin projects, but may have a more difficult time completing them,
since they can get distracted, and that is when they go off course.
:::

A 3 person also gets bored if not intellectually or creatively engaged
and may slack off if they lack self-motivation. 3s need to play and have
fun but can go too far and forget about their responsibilities
(disliking the whole idea of responsibility to themselves and others).
This happens especially when they don't have the organization to help
them stay focused on priorities. Thus they can get lazy about practicing
and developing their gifts. Dedication to their often outstanding
talents is supported by a systematic approach of their priorities. 3s
believe anything is permitted because it is so easy for them to attain
success as it is, so they use their natural happy and congenial nature
as an "escape" to chill more than is necessary.

When 3s stop consistently pursuing goals, during both easy and difficult
times, they may attribute their lack of practice to other factors. But
in the end, most inaction and lack of commitment is due to their lazy
attitude. This confusion about the **origin** of their lack of
initiative can throw them for a loop. It occurs especially when 3s
encounter mental blocks or tiredness and won't work through their
resistance with a conscious decision to act.

3s can be wise and philosophical, then witty and funny the next moment,
while abdicating discipline. This results in a lack of steady growth.
One of 3's lessons is to persevere steadfastly with their goals.

A 3 person also may have the tendency to be too talkative, sometimes
compulsively, so they need to guard against speaking when they don't
have something valuable or new to say.

There can always be too much of a good thing, and 3s can exaggerate and
even be superficial and "fake" or may make promises they can't keep.

The quickest cure for a negative emotional state or depression is to
"just do it"---to be creative. Express yourself in whichever way you
want to. Then, eventually, and usually quickly, you reconnect with the
beauty and joy in your soul and are happily on track and back in the
flow again---eager to share your gifts on some kind of stage.

[]{#ch03.xhtml#page_51 .pagebreak}Affirmation: *"I am happily engaged
with what I love to do. I lavish my focus and full attention on
activities that uplift me. I spend time with those who allow me to feel
light and free."*

#### **ROOT NUMBER 4** {.h4}

4 both is a grounding frequency (symbolizing the Earth) and carries a
mysterious quality connected to the divine. As a 4 you are practical,
trustworthy and have a hands-on approach to your life. When you commit
to something, you can be counted on to complete it. This is epitomized
by the square: four equal sides that symbolize architecture, home,
balance, and building something that lasts. So, on the one hand your
reliability, organizational skills, stable and calm demeanor,
self-discipline, meticulous attention to details, and responsible
character make you sought after as a family member, colleague, and
friend. But 4 is also an enigma, and you like it that way! (Even though
it results in others being perplexed by you.)
:::

The paradox of the 4 is that you always have one foot in the
future---this is the inventor in you wanting to go the unconventional
route and thwarting all expectations. Your ideas and values are ahead of
their time, unconventional and even prophetic. You often just have a
"knowing" about what will transpire ahead of time long before it
happens. This other side of you favors individualism, a marked
originality, and sudden, unexpected events. As a living, walking paradox
(organized and unpredictable) you are seldom fully understood, but it is
what makes you so unique. You like being unconventional!

There is a "genius" quality to your 4 vibration allows your natural
curiosity to go off the beaten path. You naturally have the focus and
discipline to explore your hunches and intuitive downloads. After all,
you love a good quest to sink your teeth into! You are rarely deterred
once you've started on such a mission.

Though you are eager to explore all possibilities that exist beyond your
own personal life, when it comes down to making internal
adjustments---shifting your personal habits---you are very stubborn.
This four-square "box" can be your hiding place to avoid taking
responsibility for your own growth and transformation.

[]{#ch03.xhtml#page_52 .pagebreak}4

If you look at the visual image of the number 4, it stands on one leg
and points a big triangle to the heavens. Thus 4s are taking the
powerful 3-6-9 Triad of Creation and grounding it, bringing it down to
Earth---making it real and practical. The lesson for a 4 person is to
stay connected to Earth while exploring the wonderful gifts in the Triad
of Creation---at the same time. Then the discoveries and shifts are
*mirrored* in their personal lives as well, as reluctance to make
personal changes dissipates.

The balance between heaven and Earth is reflected in the merging of
intuition and intelligence---**applied equally across all four areas of
human life---physical, mental, emotional and spiritual**.

Thus 4 symbolizes the real reason for our life on Earth: *We are divine
beings of light having a human experience*. We are always connected
through the Triad of Creation to Source, to the Creator, and are here to
internalize the light into practical, real-time results. We are
reflectors of the love of God---and the number 4 invites us to remember
we are members of one big galactic family.

Living in a clean, organized environment is very important for you to
stay balanced and healthy. 4 governs feng shui---the art of keeping your
physical environment energetically clear and positive---so be sure to
"feng-shui" your home and work place often. Clarity of mind thrives when
you clear your life.

4 lies in the middle of the Manifestation Triad (2-4-8), thus taking the
intuitive insights of the number 2 and manifesting them into physical
form as real, practical results.

As a 4 you love being part of a family and cherish your friends. You are
tolerant and compassionate. Money and status is not of great interest to
you (though the other numbers in your Birth Code may show otherwise).
You mix with people of all means, not caring about rank or class. It's
the "inner genius" in you---your surroundings might go unnoticed in
favor of your imagination! You live for this moment. And your tolerance
for others is exhibited in "to each their own"---something you expect in
return!

::: group
#### **Challenging expressions:** {.h4}

When you are energetically out of alignment a rigid approach to life
will appear. This fixed nature can get you stuck in a rut, as you hang
on to your opinions as if they mean more than the people you are with.
Being headstrong can also lead to arguments. A tendency to work long
hours (which naturally suits you) may turn into overwork, so be careful
about crossing the line when it comes to fulfilling tasks. If you notice
it gets to the point where you get too busy and don't ever stop to smell
the roses, take the queue and make time to simply relax and enjoy life.
Emotionally you can close down, not demonstrate affection.
:::

[]{#ch03.xhtml#page_53 .pagebreak}You may also get too serious at times,
forgetting to lighten up and go with the flow. When you find yourself
not responding to humor---and leading a humorless life---it's a sign for
you to loosen up! Hanging on to old habits and mind patterns or living
in a disorganized space will exacerbate being stuck.

Guard against being careless and not fulfilling your responsibilities. A
real disconnection from the positive expression of your number 4 results
in dishonesty and a completely undisciplined lifestyle. In this
disoriented emotional state you can inflict needless pain on yourself
through envy, jealousy, self-pity, and resentment of others. You will
waste your most precious commodity---time---as well as other resources
while fixating on comparing yourself to others or feeling self-blame and
guilt, rather than lifting yourself out of the situation (no matter how
challenging it seems at the time) by taking a step of faith, owning your
experience of it, and being accountable. For you, just doing something
valuable, no matter how big or small the gesture is, sets you back on
track!

Affirmation: *I am whole, I am complete, I am more than enough, I am who
I am---I live and let live*.

::: group
#### **ROOT NUMBER 5** {.h4}

We have arrived at the midpoint. 5 is the number right in the middle of
1 and 9.
:::

5

If you look at the image of the number 5 you can see that it faces left
(the past) at the bottom and right (the future) at the top. 5 has two
straight lines and a curved line. Thus 5 is a visual representation of
the **pivot point,** representing versatility, movement, decisions,
risk, and a new beginning of some kind.

5 also lies in the midpoint of all three triads, as well as being in the
middle of the Mind Triad (1-5-7). In this position, 5 expands your
original creative ideas through a keen intellect and intelligence. You
are adept at capturing all the various angles of a question with your
uncommon perception. You are naturally connected to higher consciousness
by virtue of your keen sense of freedom and adventure.

Exploring the unknown is your forte---whether through physical travel,
or in your mind. You are inspired by your insatiable curiosity to
experience all there is to experience! 5 governs the senses, so you want
to taste, see, smell, touch, and hear as much as you can. Though this
can result in distractions (something to watch!) you are also the
ultimate multitasker []{#ch03.xhtml#page_54 .pagebreak}and so are
designed to handle multiple tasks at one time, depending on the nature
each task requires your full attention or not. The 5 vibration is by
nature very sensual and spiritual.

You have a great magnetism and charm, which make you very attractive.
When you feel fulfilled and happy your enthusiasm makes you
irresistible, and you naturally become the center of attention in any
gathering or group.

Connection is one of your key themes. . . connecting via voice, the
internet, writing, publishing, video, radio, television, film, the arts.
You use some kind of media to meet others, gather information, share
your message---all with the goal of bringing people together. 5 governs
groups or crowds of people, making you an adept social networker as well
as performer, writer, or speaker. You enjoy big crowds! This gift of
connection also makes you a wonderful salesperson---you can sell ice to
Eskimos as long as you passionately believe it to be of value. This
persuasion power and your natural charm aligns you magically with anyone
who experiences your words, music, art, or message.

The 5 vibration is very alert and bright---not much escapes your notice.
You have an innate connection to your surroundings that makes you
extremely fine-tuned, noticing everything in great detail.

Other keywords for a 5 person are change and freedom. You are very
adaptable and thrive when there is movement---stagnation and boredom are
your greatest fears. You are the intrepid adventurer and enjoy travel or
anything that opens your heart and mind to new things, ideas, and
cultures. Being fearless is something you naturally teach others just by
the virtue of who you are. Being so engaged in the moment makes you
flexible and versatile, which delights not only you but others who come
into contact with you. You win people over with your irresistible charm
and wit, making you popular in general and helping you personally to
create momentum to bring your divine gifts to a greater audience.

Thus freedom of movement is integral to your life. You may change where
you live, travel, or wander all over the world looking for inspiration
and excitement. You also can change your mind, sometimes abruptly from
one moment to the next. Oscillation is the nature of the 5, also due to
your restless, adventurous nature. You need to feel your imagination
engaged. Stimulation of all your senses is an important factor in your
well-being.

This excitement factor shows your ability to dazzle with your
brilliance. Applause and accolades are natural by-products for you when
you live at your highest vibrational frequency. Your personality is
vivacious. Due to your alignment to subtle energetics, you have a great
sensitivity for beautiful things---both artistic and intellectual. Just
be aware that you tend to keep from emotionally engaging with ideas or
people, and this can lead to an indifference about relationships.

[]{#ch03.xhtml#page_55 .pagebreak}As a 5 person you are an agent of
change for others. Your enthusiasm and daring exhibit a wonderful zest
for life. It's as if you never grew up and have the radiant mind of a
child in your heart throughout your life. Your willingness to experience
all that the world has to offer and every facet of our human experience
is both inspiring and motivational. Due to your natural versatility and
openness, setbacks don't affect you for long---you are able to rebound
quickly and move on living so beautifully in the present moment.

5 encompasses the whole human experience, all five senses, and all
contradictions as well. Wherever you are, something is "happening,"
something is moving. You love life, adventure, and liberty. You thrive
to experience, vibrate, and live to your fullest capacity. The pivot
point aspect of your number also indicates that you may fluctuate from
feeling totally exalted to profoundly down for seemingly no
reason---except that others just don't understand how intensely you
**experience** life and that you thus need time to adjust. Your approach
is one of total immersion---taking in the obvious and all the subtleties
at once. Others around you may not be as tuned into the subtle energies
that you pick up, but it is this full-immersion experience that delights
and inspires you the most.

::: group
#### **Challenging expressions:** {.h4}

You may be very critical when you are not energetically aligned with the
positive expression of number 5, and this will lead to an urge to spot
mistakes and flaws and point them out (others, and your own). Try not to
be impatient when doing so, or refrain altogether.
:::

You may be quick to use your mind instead of your heart to over-analyze
people and situations, using the intellect instead of your feelings to
find answers. Logic appeals to you however, you must be vulnerable and
open up the tenderness in your heart. Getting analytical at the expense
of heart-to-heart connections, especially in your intimate
relationships, can lead to endings and breakups. Yes, love runs deep,
but under too much incessant scrutiny, it has no breathing room to live
and thrive. Using your instincts to navigate love, instead of talking
through it or intellectualizing the experience (thereby not allowing the
space to assimilate feelings), is important if you are to maintain deep,
loving relationships.

You can be high-strung, have a nervous disposition, and crave change for
the sake of change. Guard against impulsive actions---and reactions. Any
restlessness you have can be channeled into doing something new!

Addiction is another shadow side of this number, since you want to try
everything. If you go too far, then you forget to use discernment and to
choose only what is for your highest good. Since you crave change and
[]{#ch03.xhtml#page_56 .pagebreak}are so versatile, you may enter and
exit relationships quickly, rather than allowing them to evolve and
grow.

If you find yourself criticizing others while at the same time not being
responsible for your own life, you will vacillate through life blindly,
not seeing a need to course-correct, not recognizing the valuable
feedback coming your way, and not benefitting from the experiences that
would enable you to mature emotionally.

Your attention is captured by many things at once, and so you may not
stay true to your *initial* impulses. Patience and learning how to
center your brilliant, magnificent gifts are the key for you to maintain
calm and peace and your delightful enthusiasm for life.

Affirmation: *I sing a song of delight. I take pleasure in everything I
encounter. I surrender. I feel blessed!*

#### **ROOT NUMBER 6** {.h4}

As a 6 person you are deeply compassionate, loving, and responsible
toward your family and friends. You have a calming influence on others.
6 is aligned with beauty and is the middle number in the 3-6-9 Creation
Triad giving birth to the creative seeds and impulses received from the
number 3.
:::

6

If you look at the image of the 6, it is shaped in the form of a woman
who is with child---pregnant with a large belly, about to give birth and
take on the responsibility of a parent. This is the key to the number
6---nurturing others, being of loving service to others, being
supportive and utterly devoted. You naturally want to "mother" and share
your advice. Inevitably people, friends, even strangers, will come to
you and tell you their deepest secrets, share private and personal
information with you that they wouldn't with others. You exude a warmth,
compassion, and wisdom that holds the space for love. It's like you hold
an invisible invitation for others to seek you out as an advisor,
healer, mentor. . . without you actually having put out any conscious
signals. Thus make sure you consciously create boundaries, otherwise you
will feel energetically depleted. Also, make sure you make room in your
life to nurture **yourself**---with massage, reflexology, energy
healing---to recharge your vibrational field. You love to give, and you
must learn to receive the bounty of love and luxuries life has to offer!

You love to give affection and hugs and are very generous with your
resources and time. Your natural poise and charisma make you highly
magnetic. . . when you walk into a room, people take note!

[]{#ch03.xhtml#page_57 .pagebreak}6 governs human love and romance as
well as money and abundance. In your intimate relationships, once you
commit to a partnership you are devoted. This devotion extends to your
loved ones and friends---who genuinely love you. You can get sentimental
(and may try to hide this) and very idealistic. You are attuned to
exhibiting good manners and are tasteful, yet will not shy away from
expressing yourself strongly when you feel passionate about something.

Harmony and beauty are so important to your well-being, and to attract
abundance you must surround yourself with high aesthetics. Jarring
noises, conflict, arguments, discord, jealousy, and unresolved issues
are best eliminated or dealt with as quickly as possible in order for
you to pursue the rest of your day at peace.

Your natural artistic side needs to be expressed. You naturally enjoy
beautiful music, exquisite art, furniture, and clothing, so adorn and
surround yourself with beauty to feel good and whole. When at home,
though, you like to dress comfortably. As a 6 it is important for you to
live in a sensually pleasing environment. Anything that feels "ugly"
needs to be removed---you are so sensitive to vibration, sound, and
visuals. You love having your favorite colors and artwork in your home.
Living in a place of serenity and beauty pleases you to no end.

Money is attracted to you when you are positively aligned with your
Birth Code. Sometimes it can appear without much effort through
inheritances, wealthy friends, or sponsors, but just as often it is
through your talents and abilities that magnetically attract abundance.

You are highly creative and must find an outlet at work or elsewhere to
express your innate artistic gifts. Use your voice whenever you can, the
sound of your voice carries healing vibrations. You can use it in your
career to speak, teach, counsel others, share information, or sing, in
the healing arts or in politics. Like the number 3, you have a smile
that is irresistible!

You also are very attuned to justice, seeking to find the underlying
fair response to any situation. This means you want the law to be upheld
and understand the need the rules of law has to honor the basic needs
and sanctity for any person.

As a 6 you are good at finishing projects once you can get yourself
started.

::: group
#### []{#ch03.xhtml#page_58 .pagebreak}**Challenging expressions:** {.h4}

6 out of alignment can lead to a controlling and interfering nature,
where you meddle in other people's business. This can be reflected in
your family relationships, partnerships or friendships. Then you'll
argue your point to stay in power and cause a lot of disruption. This
bossy side will replace your natural nurturing instincts with a
domineering attitude towards others.
:::

You can be a perfectionist and this can lead to criticism of others,
since you will expect them to perform to your high standards. Sometimes
you can resort to self-righteous behavior. Another shadow side of the 6
expression is total self-absorption.

When not aligned, money matters can range along a spectrum from where
you overspend and are too extravagant or extremely stingy. Regarding
overindulgence, you need to watch your sweet tooth!

Another challenging aspect of this 6 vibration is that you may want to
follow the path of least resistance (and keep a false sense of harmony).
You can be careless concerning your responsibilities, especially
regarding the obligation you have to yourself to fulfill your divine
mission. This will create a quality of being a "drifter," someone who
does not make commitments to themselves and would rather "go with the
flow," drifting from here to there to nowhere, since there was no
conscious dedication to a specific mission or project or goal. Your
indecision, laziness, and feeling like you are being inconvenienced by
choosing to commit to something will make you the root cause of your
failed half-hearted attempts. It also creates a spiraling tendency to
magnify difficulties and obsess on problems, which are quite often not
even real.

**Everyone** is confronted with adversity, lackluster days, and
challenges; thus it is vital for a 6 person to overcome the inertia that
can recur a daily basis or every so often.

In order for you as a 6 to accomplish something meaningful and joyful,
something that has *real impact* on your life, you must be motivated
internally and externally to do anything---preferably through a goal or
deadline---so as to overcome your occasional passive nature. Then you
will shower the world with your loving radiance and brilliance!

Affirmation: *I share my love freely and generously. I practice using my
gifts every day. I nurture myself. I care deeply about my divine mission
to uplift others through love and joy*.

::: group
#### []{#ch03.xhtml#page_59 .pagebreak}**ROOT NUMBER 7** {.h4}

7 is a number of the spiritual seeker, the sensitive, mindful
philosopher, and, brilliant analyzer. As a 7 you are driven to
understand the mysteries of life, to grasp the unknown. You are
comfortable with secret subjects, the healing modalities, and usually
have vivid dreams. Even if you are not attracted to spiritual subjects,
as a 7 you love to learn, read books (you may have books in every room
of your home), and educate yourself---exhibiting a quest for gathering
knowledge and gaining understanding.
:::

Ultimately 7 is the number of spiritual completion. Inner peace and calm
are brought about through bridging the higher world with the world
below---heaven and Earth---as the inner and outer realms are understood
to be one and the same.

7

The image of the number 7 has a horizontal line at the top, symbolizing
the world above, or heaven, with a diagonal line reaching below,
signifying a bridging to the lower world. 7 also looks like a lightning
bolt and symbolizes lightning insights, intuitive downloads that come
out of the blue and light up your mind. So 7 can bridge anything, making
connections between ideas and subjects that seemingly have no common
ground, such as good and evil, light and dark. As a symbol of lightning,
7s can experience sudden profound shifts in their lives that take them
by total surprise. The effect of the lightning bolt also makes 7 a
"change agent." Often their presence alone can soothe and heal.

Notice, too, that the 7 "opens up" to the left---the past. Thus 7 has a
good memory, and enjoys looking back at history to gather wisdom and
understanding of the present. 7 "points" diagonally to the upper left,
which signifies its interest in developing new ways of being, future
technological or scientific breakthroughs, psychic premonitions of the
future, and an intuitive understanding of reaching into other
dimensions. Thus a 7 person often has unorthodox, unique beliefs and
values.

Due to their quest for knowledge, 7 people need to travel extensively at
some point in their lifetime or read many books about other lands, other
cultures, and even beyond Earth, space, and time.

Financially it is important for 7s to have a nest egg. Otherwise they
get nervous about the future. This anxious tendency can interfere with
their ultimate mission to be a channel for new wisdom.

7 symbolizes the original seven Wonders of the World, great mystery,
magic, and ceremony. Thus as a 7 person you have a tendency to look
deeply at everything. You are an observer of the mysteries of life, a
seeker of wisdom, and a natural researcher. You do best when you have
extended periods of time alone---sometimes even going through periods
where you []{#ch03.xhtml#page_60 .pagebreak}are a hermit. In fact, it's
best for you to work alone. As Pythagoras said, "Those who desire wisdom
should look for it in solitude."

Your views and values can at times be mysterious to others, as your
quest for wisdom possibly changed the beliefs of your early life and
helped you connect your divine nature.

7 is the final number in the 1-5-7 Mind Triad. Thus it carries
tremendous intelligence. You can be taken aback at times by the lack of
understanding and intellectual capacities in others. For you the
questions of "Why?" are truly integral to your thirst for knowledge. You
like to approach life from a logical perspective, yet eventually must
merge intuition with logic to get to the deeper mysteries you yearn to
solve. Specializing in any field suits you well, as you can then put all
your eggs in one basket and delve into the infinite depths, exploring
knowledge and wisdom indefinitely. If you ever feel the well has dried
up or been explored completely, it is important for you to find another
source of life to satisfy your natural curiosity and to expand your
knowledge and inner capacity to cradle great wisdom. You're naturally
not a fan of anything frivolous or superficial.

You do not like to be under anyone's watchful eye! That includes an
abhorrence of "Big Brother." Any person or entity that invades your
privacy, which you guard like a lioness guards her cubs, is not welcome.
You keep your private life secret and at the same time have "eyes in
back of your head," taking in everything around you. When you enter a
space you feel what's going on, even though you'd never let on about
it. . . this is what makes 7 a number of holding secrets. It is no
coincidence the most famous fictional spy, James Bond, is "007"!

If a 7 person goes into the creative arts, their ability to both learn
and intuitively channel makes them quite a magnetic and unique
performer, writer or artist in any field.

In your intimate relationships you need privacy and a "cave" to escape
to for solitude. You can be very loving and devoted, as long as you
don't expect your partner to live up to your long list of ideals. Since
you can intuitively sense the true from the untrue, you can jump ahead
and not create the space for your partner to discover the wisdom and
truth in their own way and on their own time. Others need to earn their
trust with you, but once they have it you embrace them with complete
non-judgment and openness---and in turn expect the same from them!

You thrive when you are in nature---especially near the ocean. Take many
getaways---7 rules rest, rejuvenation, meditation, and sabbaticals.
Refresh your heart, mind, and soul with long stays in places that feel
like spiritual sanctuaries.

The bridge that 7 symbolizes will be a metaphor for growth all your
life. Bring the sacredness of bridging light and dark, seen and unseen,
into []{#ch03.xhtml#page_61 .pagebreak}your daily life. Make your life a
ceremony, a devoted song to Spirit, Source, or God. You understand the
reason for darkness, and you, as the lightning bolt of truth, radiate
brilliance. You are a beacon of light in the world. Shining your light
in darkness in whatever way, shape, or form that takes, is your divine
gift. Opening up the sacred halls of wisdom within you will give you
direct access to the truth---as revealed in the records of time and
timelessness.

Always remember, your divine mission can benefit a big community of
like-minded souls---and then reach out to inspire the world.

::: group
#### **Challenging expressions:** {.h4}

Due to your wisdom and natural quest for knowledge, you can get
impatient with those who in your mind cannot "catch on" fast enough.
Also, since you can easily spot when something is wrong, your
perfectionism may turn you into a critic with a need for perfect
results---rather than being open to what is for the highest good of the
situation. Guard against being cynical about life, either because others
have disappointed you, or due to unresolved emotions arising from
previous life experiences.
:::

You have a strong personality, so it's important for you to balance your
strong energy with time for playfulness. Otherwise you will focus on the
powerful, accomplishment qualities of the 7 at the expense of joy and
love.

You can be very secretive, not revealing much about your true
motivations. It's natural for you to keep your own issues private, yet
not at the expense of being distrustful or not trusting of others. In
intimate relationships it is important for you to be vulnerable
*emotionally*, not just *intellectually* (sometimes you mistake the
intellectual openness for emotional vulnerability).

When out of alignment you get pessimistic and frustrated. Know, this is
when you try to direct your aha moments in an obsessive way, rather than
being a channel for light and love, without conditions on how or in what
area that wisdom is to stream through you. A change of place or time in
nature will usually help you reconnect very quickly!

Affirmation: *I am truth embodied. My soul is my true home. I live to
share the light of wisdom*.

#### []{#ch03.xhtml#page_62 .pagebreak}**ROOT NUMBER 8** {.h4}

8 is the vibration of leadership and strength, abundance, financial
security, and power. 8 people have a vision that must be made practical.
Thus 8 governs entrepreneurship and the executive. 8s are responsible
and patient by nature, allowing them to take an idea from its inception
to a successful outcome. It is natural for an 8 person to at some point
in their life to experience obstacles and ups and downs---however, these
are designed to be overcome in order to gain confidence and strength. As
an 8 person you use any challenges as stepping-stones to success.
:::

You are shy and reserved by nature. It is not immediately obvious that
you have the fortitude to push forward, but you persist every step of
the way, and eventually reach your goal. Nothing and no-one will stop
you from achieving your mission. Your quiet nature is a protection of
your intensely driven nature to reach the pinnacle of your profession.
Your strength, fortitude, and internal power to succeed are exhibited in
the visual image of the number 8.

8 is the final of three numbers in the 2-4-8 Manifestation Triad.

8

8 looks like a vertical infinity symbol---and it does represent eternal
life. This is the only number besides 0 which you can draw repeatedly
without lifting your pen. 8 is also visual representation of two
windows, with the window above giving a vision of the spiritual and the
one below relating to the material. Thus 8 represents making visions
(messages from spirit) real, bringing them to Earth, and materializing
them into goods that can be exchanged for money.

8 represents the energy exchange of money.

8 is aligned with business, in that this vibration takes a vision
(spirit), creates a product or service (matter), puts it out into the
world (enterprise), and in return receives payment for that product or
service. This is one of the core spiritual and human energy exchanges to
life. Whereas the number 4 symbolizes the manifestation of creative
ideas, 8 takes it one step further by adding the financial energy
exchange. Both the spiritual and material realms represented by the
number 8 are necessary to experience fulfillment and abundance. In some
way or another an 8 person will be focused on money
manifestation---whether they have it or not. Usually they will have
experiences of both. Either way, it is only once their soul is
completely free to manifest those messages from spirit that 8 people
realize their dreams of lasting abundance and fulfillment. Often, they
end up as an example or teacher of spiritual, manifestation, and/or
financial laws.

[]{#ch03.xhtml#page_63 .pagebreak}An 8 person is meant to lead in some
capacity. They need not be a success in the financial or business world,
as long as they have access to an environment where they can inspire
others to greater heights with their vision. The infinity symbol also
implies that 8 people are like a battery that keeps going and going,
never giving up.

At the same time, you as an 8 are very realistic and have great
organizational skills. Your innate patience and intelligence allow you
to excel at anything. You are born with a desire to take on
responsibilities, so it is rare to find an 8 who is careless, since they
pride themselves on living up to the highest expectations. Their
reliability is legendary, and so is their warmth.

8s like to keep a certain image of themselves that is strong as befits
the leaders they are. However they do care about what others feel about
them, especially when it comes to their accomplishments, and do
(privately) enjoy compliments.

The symbol of infinity is also reflected in the balance of justice and
honor that 8 people represent. They have a very advanced sense of what
is ethical and true, representing honor, impartiality, and dignity in
everything they say and do. Thus they also like to mix with dignitaries,
seeking the company of important, influential people---a group that they
naturally know they "belong" to.

It is important for you as an 8 person to share your resources with
others in a philanthropic way. When positively aligned, 8s can
materialize anything---they are magical at turning their visions into
reality. Their penchant for persistence and courage as well as their
cooperative nature, allows 8s to accomplish anything they set their mind
to when it comes to working with others. 8 people are ambitious, enjoy
challenges, and strive to be the best they can be. They have both
originality and inspiration, so as long as they create something that
fulfills them at soul-level, combining their multiple talents in a
practical way, they will be successful. They can act as instruments of
positive shifts in other people's lives.

As friends they are loyal, dedicated, and so sweet with those whom they
trust and care for deeply. However, due to their need to appear strong
with no need in the world, 8s can feel lonely, with a great need to be
loved and cherished. If a dear friend or family member needs them for
any purpose, the 8 person will make sacrifices for them---no questions
asked. They will do the same for an ideal.

You as an 8 person are only attracted to quality and will not be seen
shopping for secondhand clothes. You value the best and will wait to
secure the highest quality in favor of a cheaper version. This is
because you are aligned with the vibration of longevity.

[]{#ch03.xhtml#page_64 .pagebreak}As an 8 your dreams are never small!
Everything you do has to exhibit your highest expectations of what is
"the best." 8s have the inner courage, the natural leadership, and the
vision to achieve greatness in any field. Their enjoyment of challenges
and creating the best possible outcome for the highest good of all makes
them unstoppable and wonderful contributors and influencers.

::: group
#### **Challenging expressions:** {.h4}

An 8 out of alignment is egotistical, materialistic, and forceful---or
succumbs to passive and powerless behavior. Their longing for success
can outweigh their desire for happiness. Thus 8s must pay attention to
their heart. . . if there is a feeling of loneliness, if there is a
sense of longing for something that is missing, an 8 must not be afraid
to pursue happiness with the same wisdom, maturity, and discipline that
they devote to their divine mission.
:::

8s are demanding of themselves and transfer that quest for excellence
and success onto others, which is not necessarily a negative unless it
is expected and those who do not measure up are judged. You may take
your ambitious drive too far if you are out of alignment energetically.
You will work without reservation for many hours to achieve your goal
but can forget to stop and smell the roses, not allowing yourself to
enjoy anything else on the journey you are taking. This means you may
not be able to fully enjoy the actual goal once you attain it. . . you
have put so much focus on the getting the result that when it happens,
you refocus on the next goal without taking some time to appreciate the
beauty you've created. Eventually this lack of appreciation along the
way can lead to frustration and dissatisfaction.

Your are dedication to being actively engaged in the pursuit of your
vision is commendable as long as you pay attention when you feel
restless, or that there is something "missing" along the way. If not,
you might eventually react with tremendous anger when provoked or
exhibit a suctioning of strength in your physical body that translates
into health conditions or a need for rest.

Guard against being egotistical and vindictive, obstinate, intolerant,
and stubborn.

Affirmation: *I give everything to inspire others to be the best they
can be. My deeds are my expressions of wealth and well-being. I am
enriched by helping to enrich others*.

::: group
#### []{#ch03.xhtml#page_65 .pagebreak}**ROOT NUMBER 9** {.h4}

9 is the number of transformation---something needs to end to begin
again. Thus 9 can regenerate itself over and over again and exhibits a
great determination. This number symbolizes evolution and an enhancement
of psychic abilities and clairvoyance. You'll see shortly how the
regeneration quality of the number 9 is confirmed in mathematics and the
whole human experience on Earth---9 is the King of Numbers and will
reign forever. A 9 person is warm, outgoing, and loving with a dramatic
flair, exuding a magnetic personality that allows him or her to get
along with pretty much anyone. 9s are compassionate, romantic, filled
with unconditional love, kind, empathetic, patient, tolerant, and wise.
You as a 9 are an inspirational and compassionate humanitarian with
great idealism and strong willpower. Your imagination knows no bounds!
And you absolutely love to give.
:::

As a 9 you have a powerful personality, and you can use it to fulfill
your greatest desire---to be useful to others by manifesting
inspirational accomplishments and/or beneficial products or results. You
represent *leadership by example*---others will look to you as an
example to be followed, whether you are aware of it or not. Your
charisma exudes loving confidence, so you need to accept the example you
set and allow the quality of life you lead to speak for itself, since it
will be emulated by others. You *live* your talk. You want your high
ideals to inspire others so they too experience their highest potential.

Your sweet-natured soul does not like seeing anyone in pain. When you
see someone who is suffering, you reach out to them since you truly care
about how others feel. And if you have healing balm or
stress-alleviation tool, you will share it. You are a natural at
teaching, healing, and giving counsel through the highest values of love
and beauty. Your ultimate goal is to raise the vibrational awareness of
humanity.

You are naturally very direct and expect the same from others---what you
say is exactly how you feel. So you don't tend to play games to get what
you want; you just ask for what you want!

9

9 has a circle at the top, representing a big head filled with wisdom
(or ego) learned from the numbers 1 through 8 that preceded it. The
"head" is connected to Earth by a line on the right side, representing
the artistic, creative side of the human experience. The wisdom and
leadership of 9 make it very evolved. You are here to help people, often
through major transitions, since 9 also represents endings. In order to
have the capacity to love deeply, without judgment or expectation, you
yourself experienced hardship and tests. Those who are born to help
others experience the pain []{#ch03.xhtml#page_66 .pagebreak}and loss
themselves in order to forgive and have compassion at the deepest level
of the human experience.

Another result of your emotional connection is that you understand
people from all walks of life. You respect all their various qualities
and missions. You also love giving back---having a charitable and
philanthropic nature. Your sensitive, artistic nature blends with your
quest for perfection. As a leader you demand only the best from
yourself.

9 is the final number in the 3-6-9 Creation Triad and thus represents a
culmination and celebration of a mission accomplished. Your main lesson
is to elevate what is seemingly everyday and ordinary into something
that is extraordinary and meaningful.

You are naturally honest and direct---getting straight to the point and
penetrating directly to the heart of the matter. When others are not
direct with you, it takes you by surprise. Other people's dishonesty,
manipulation, or indirectness can catch you off-guard, so you need to
learn to be more cautious with others, but not when you are teaching.
Another quality to guard against is your impatience with those who think
more slowly than you do or others who don't recognize the thought
patterns and actions that lead up to a mistake. You like to be in
control on some level, so this can be a challenging area for you.

No detail escapes your keen observation---as you have a clear, sharp
mind that penetrates quickly to the root of the matter while grasping
the overall picture. So you are conscious of all energy, subtle and
visible, happening around you.

In relationships you may strive to be in control. With your independent
streak, you may keep your distance, which results in a lack of true
intimacy. You can be an enigma in this way, due to your warm, generous
nature and your lack of commitment to a serious relationship. This is
also connected 9's symbol of endings, so you somehow know that
everything will come to an end, and this may keep you from fully
engaging with another heart-to-heart.

You approach life with total passion and a profound intensity. Your
vibrant and noble nature, enthusiasm, and generosity are noted by
everyone who is blessed to be in your presence.

::: group
#### **Challenging expressions:** {.h4}

When you are energetically out of alignment you hold onto resentments or
memories, not letting them go. You become resentful of life and can shut
down emotionally. Guard against being arrogant, tyrannical, or
dishonest. An abdication of leadership can result in you closing your
mind to wisdom and drifting through life aimlessly---dissipating your
gifts. Frustration is a sign that you must reconnect with your
heart-center and surrender to love.
:::

[]{#ch03.xhtml#page_67 .pagebreak}Guard against focusing on limitations.
This will push you to want to control others, since you are not healing
your own sense of lack within first. Rather than feeling the need to
control, shift your focus onto creating beauty, love, and excellence.
Your role is to exude the joy of living a life to its highest potential.
When you focus on what is for your highest good, your emotional
touchiness will naturally disappear.

When out of alignment you can be stubborn, reacting with aggressive
action and creating conflict as a result. Though your temper can rise to
a boil quickly, you can just as quickly move on, ready to forgive and
forget.

Your natural inclination to be direct can turn into a frankness that is
too confrontational or aggressive. Speaking your mind without caring
about how this might affect the other person(s) results in consequences
that are not healing or beneficial. Refrain from reacting
instantaneously, especially when the result is biting in nature.

Deep down you can have a fear of rejection and then will feel a lack of
confidence. Then, reassurance that you are appreciated, understood,
respected, and loved is something you need and crave.

Affirmation: *I serve others with love and wisdom. I stay true to my
heart, leading always with love and for the highest good of all*.

## MASTER NUMBERS 11--99 {.h2t}

[N]{.dropcap}[OW WE WILL ENTER THE MYSTERIOUS REALM OF DOUBLE-DIGIT
NUMBERS]{.f3} 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, [AND]{.f3} 99, [ALSO
REFERRED TO AS "MASTER NUMBERS]{.f3}." A Master Numbers is an
intensification of a single-digit number, so the core meaning of the
single-digit before it is doubled, is incorporated in a new experience,
which takes on messages of the single and double digit and *blends* them
into a *new* vision.

Master Numbers by nature carry a greater responsibility than
single-digit vibrations. In order to elevate yourself to the higher
calling of a Master Number you must listen intently to your inner
calling, which always will reveal your soul's chosen path.

::: group
### []{#ch04.xhtml#page_69 .pagebreak}MASTER NUMBER 11 {.h3}

If your Day of Birth is 11 or 29 or your Life Purpose or Destiny reduces
to 11 (such as 38, 47, 56, etc. and 119, 128, 137, etc.), then Master
Number 11 is one of your Three Important Birth Numbers.
:::

*Please read the meaning for number 2 (in [chapter
3](#ch03.xhtml#ch03)), the "root number" for 11, as well*.

When 1 becomes 11, the *original creative mind* and *leadership* of
number 1 are incorporated into 11 as the Psychic Master, blending 1 into
an experience of double new beginnings and enlightened leadership. 11 is
supreme balance. Balance between light and dark, masculine and feminine,
the seen and unseen, the known and unknown. Thus you as an 11 symbolize
both the seen and unseen, which need to be brought into equilibrium.
However, there is an illusion heaven and earth, visible and invisible,
are separate, and you must bypass this illusion of division by uniting
seemingly separate energies and goals. When you do so, you will stop
feeling a sense of incompletion and division running through your life.

As a "Master Number" you are being asked to master something at a high
level. For the 11 you are mastering listening to your inner voice---the
only true voice connected to your divinity, your soul. Anytime you feel
a sense of separation or division, tune in. This division could appear
from a person or an interfering idea or ignorance. If you refuse to see
*both* sides, listen and understand, you will prevent a rebalancing of
energy from occurring. In all cases of conflict or separation your role
is to find out the source of opposing energy. Then the magical shift
happens when you understand the Law of Opposites. That in order to
experience light you must also know darkness. Then, exquisite harmony
and peace infuse your heart as you listen intently---surrendering to the
light of wisdom within you.

Any nervousness, which comes as a result of 11 ruling light and
electrical currents, can be healed through establishing routine and
order in your life.

The ancient temples of mystery had a pillar on each side of the
entrance, looking very much like the figure 11. These pillars are a
doorway and symbolize an initiation. Your overall divine mission is to
delve into the mysteries and miracles of life---to walk *through* the
two pillars and unite active and passive, emptiness and fullness,
receptivity and action. All becomes *one* within you. When you enter the
Temple of Awareness, you have made a choice to live fully, with total
acceptance of every situation that appears before you as being by your
design, your beckoning---and always for your highest good. No matter how
it appears!

[]{#ch04.xhtml#page_71 .pagebreak}*"In order to elevate yourself to the
higher calling of a Master Number you must listen intently to your inner
calling which always will reveal your soul's chosen path."*

Anything can be channeled through this opening---a new invention, an
intuitive download, a piece of music or art, a book. Channeling a gift
is the highest expression of this number. The gift is always bringing
forth brand-new information and inspiration---the initial experience of
the unknown, thus making the unknown visible.

It is no surprise then that 11 symbolizes light (the word "light" adds
up to 29/11 using the Pythagorean system).

As an 11 you illuminate the truth. You have a choice to illuminate
negative or positive energy, but you *will* channel energy and bring it
to light. To prepare to channel what is *for your highest good*, it is
initially important for you to discover your "inner teacher."
Reconnecting to your inner voice is another way of describing your
conscious engagement with your spiritual guides. You also receive great
inspiration through symbols, music, art, and sacred geometry. Aligning
to your soul opens up a universe of wisdom that you can access at will,
instantaneously, and then share with others. It is by walking between
light and dark, keeping the balance, standing secure on both feet, like
the 11, that allows you to open up your creative vessel and let the
divine pour through the 11.

You must always choose which endeavors in your life bring unity and
which cause separation. You will need to get off the fence and make a
choice. That choice will enable you to enter the 11 gateway, take that
risk, and live fully in the present moment. This is when you feel whole.
Once the way to unity is recognized, honored, and practiced
continuously, you leave the struggle and division behind. You feel at
peace. It is in the act of surrender that you fulfill your role to be a
Master of Light and Love.

If you don't step through the gateway, explore your inner world---both
the light and the darkness---you will project your fantasies and
neuroses on others instead and eventually sabotage your goals. Life is
filled with paradoxes, so there is no reason to doubt the importance of
every experience as being valid. If you exclude exploring all sides of
an issue you leave out part of the human experience. Your role is to be
unconditional in your tolerance of those people and experiences that
seem different. Then your 11 gateway is totally about freedom and
unconditional love.

[]{#ch04.xhtml#page_72 .pagebreak}In exploring the dark and the light,
the seen and the unseen, nothing escapes you, and you walk the world an
avatar of love. Instead of fighting injustice, you heal. Instead of
resisting oppression and pain, you understand that *all* that happens to
you has been called in by your soul. Nothing happens to us that is not
ultimately for our highest good.

As an 11 you understand there is a veil of illusion---maya---that
appears once we are born on Earth, protecting us from knowing everything
we've experienced and will experience. Otherwise we would be overwhelmed
and not able to function. That veil is lifted for a bit every time we
enter the 11 portal. In the entering of the gateway, light beams through
our third eye and reveals our true divine origin. We become "seers"
enlightened by entering the light. This is the moment-to-moment
enlightenment, the union with love we so yearn for. So, the more you as
an 11 trust and surrender to your intuition, the higher you raise your
vibration. 11 is the Master teacher.

Anyone who crosses your path will be enchanted by your undeniable
charisma. You just change people by the sheer influence of your powerful
aura. For you personally this spiritual essence appears as unexpected
windfalls, seemingly coincidental, that appear in synchronicity with
your goals---guiding you to the light so that you can play the leading
role you are meant to. Surprises and unexpected events are part of your
life. Allow yourself to be guided by this invisible force---as you too
wield an invisible, magical influence on others.

### MASTER NUMBER 22 {.h3}

If you are born on the 22nd day of any month or have a 22 Life Purpose
Number and/or 22 Destiny Number, you have the qualities of not only root
number 4, but the Master Number 22.
:::

*Please read the meaning for number 4 (in [chapter
3](#ch03.xhtml#ch03)), the "root number" for 22, as well*.

You are the Master Architect of Peace. You manifest achievement and
build your dreams into reality. You work hard and embody the power of
the Buddha Principle. I refer to 22 as the "Buddha" Number.

Master Number 22 intensifies the single-digit 4, representing work,
discipline, and honesty, which arrives in 22 through peace, intuition,
and cooperation. Thus your work encompasses spiritual self-study,
spiritual self-discipline, and spiritual honesty.

[]{#ch04.xhtml#page_73 .pagebreak}*"11 is supreme balance. Balance
between light and dark, masculine and feminine, the seen and unseen, the
known and unknown."*

As a 22, you are ...

\* Able to download higher divine wisdom into physical reality

\* Designed to build a project/business/idea from the ground up with
lasting results

\* A master at invoking peace and calm in daily life

In order to create peaceful solutions and manifest results with lasting
impact you need to be highly disciplined. At times you might feel like
you are inferior or don't have all the internal tools necessary. This
false belief will propel you to rely too much on outside sources or
people's opinions for approval. Understand that you are here as a Master
Number 22 to rely on your own abilities---which requires tremendous
inner strength. In order to be a master of manifestation you need
patience and strong vigilance to stay "on track."

The root number 4 that 22 reduces to gives you the gifts of planning,
dedication, and order so that you don't veer off into areas that are
irrelevant or even detrimental to your well-being. Without consistent
monitoring of your actions, though, done with full integrity and
honesty, you may get blinded by negative actions of people around you
that will lead to delusion and frustration. You will experience illusion
instead of inner illumination.

Master Numbers ask more of you---they also give you the tools to
accomplish more! So use your ability to *discern* truth from illusion.
Slay the dragons of fear and nebulous energy and replace them with the
magnificent light of truth.

Recognize your spiritual mastery---reflected in how you take
responsibility, in spiritual acceptance of how life shows up for you.
Practice this spiritual responsibility in your daily life, in your
relationships, and to accomplish your goals. Remember that the roles
other people play in your life are for multitude reasons---including
showing you what *not* to do! This is just as valid a lesson as the
person who inspires you as a positive role model. Accepting all
experiences and relationships as valid and useful in some way is the key
to helping you to the inertia to inner change you can encounter. Some
situations or individuals are so challenging that you will make major
shifts that result in life-changing readjustments and end up
[]{#ch04.xhtml#page_74 .pagebreak}wielding a positive impact on you.
Others will refine your sensitivity, propelling you to step into a new
role in uplifting society.

Thus if you refrain from inner growth by avoiding pain, you can miss out
on developing an incredibly profound understanding of peace---of what
creates peace and what keeps us from feeling at peace. The basics
surrounding the question and answer to what constitutes a life of peace
are there for you to unlock in your soul. You know that there is a
necessary process that we as human beings need to experience to create
that inner transformation from ego self to spiritual being, and that
this awakening comes as a result of self-awareness and self-acceptance.
You understand that when we become adults we must move into
self-realization, not rely on others to replace our parents, previous
guidance. In the same way it is important for you not to be caught up in
fads, the latest trends, and keeping up with your friends or neighbors
in an attempt for outside approval. Conformity is the shadow side of
22/4. Being independent and free to create your *own* order based on
your own truth and accepting the consequences of your actions as
feedback from the universe (not judgment) is vital to your peace and
well-being.

When you as a 22 are out of alignment you can succumb to indifference,
being aimless, reckless, apathetic, self-important, frustrated. You may
resent a lack of recognition, be envious of other's successes, and
exaggerate.

22/4 encompasses two of three numbers in the 2-4-8 Manifestation Triad,
and thus it carries great energy---accomplishments made real. Any area
you pursue will allow you to achieve a position of distinction because
you are not afraid of challenges and see them as necessary, even
welcome, stepping-stones to success. Master Numbers carry majesty and
greatness, and your expression of that power comes through your capacity
to manifest by planning great projects which you direct into existence
(rather than manage the intricacies---you must leave the trivial matters
to others). As the "Architect of Peace" Master Number you always want to
be at peace with your work and values so you can also enjoy the benefits
of the power bestowed on you. Guard against using your ambition to
manifest only for personal profit without caring *how* you arrive at
your goals.

### MASTER NUMBER 33 {.h3}

If you have a 33 Life Purpose Number and/or 33 Destiny Number, you have
the qualities of not only root number 6 but the Master Number 33. (There
is no 33 Day of Birth.)
:::

*Please read the meaning for number 6 (in [Chapter
3](#ch03.xhtml#ch03)), the "root number" for 33, as well*.

[]{#ch04.xhtml#page_75 .pagebreak}You embody the Selfless Giver and the
Cosmic Guardian. Others look to you as an example. You have to discern
between martyrdom and compassionate service.

As a 33, you are ...

\* Highly sensitive and could be a powerful empath

\* Designed to be a teacher of compassion

\* Concerned for the welfare of the masses

When expressed at its highest vibrational alignment Master Number 33
symbolizes a person who embodies unconditional love. 33 carries all the
qualities of its root number, 6 (see [chapter 3](#ch03.xhtml#ch03)), yet
is even more sensitive---feeling people's emotions as deeply as their
own. This is the kind of love that says to anyone who crosses your path,
"I accept you and love you no matter what you do or don't do. I will
always continue to love you regardless."

This unconditional love is extended to *you* as well. When the time
comes and you are at the point of transitioning to another dimension,
you will only remember whether you have been of service and loved to the
fullest extent possible. Nothing else will matter more than having led a
life of meaning and a life of love. Service and compassion create our
most profound experiences of love and joy. And 33/6 encompasses the
gamut of this underlying yearning for human beings to serve and love one
another.

In order to tune into the depths of heart-centered connection required
for this level of compassion there are times when you may experience
great doubt or distress, delusion, and disappointment in your life.
There are many responsibilities a 33/6 Master Number person takes on to
understand how to consistently activate the deep empathy of this
powerful vibration. It is said that Jesus died on the cross at age 33,
accepting all the whole human experience as his own, welcoming it all
with great humility, in service to humanity's awakening to love. This is
the ultimate expression of the 33, a love that gives birth to the
highest ideals through the death of the ego.

Note that our spinal column has 33 verterbrae, which act as the backbone
of our human body. Thus 33 takes on both the physical and emotional
expression of our human experience and embodies the chakras.

You may struggle with issues of intimacy and loyalty. Putting yourself
in a loved ones, shoes is integral to your emotional growth. This means
looking in the mirror and reflecting on how your words impact others,
how your actions impress everyone affected. You also can have a tendency
for being a perfectionist---expectations of perfection are contrary to
forgiveness---and you must learn to forgive others for not measuring up,
beginning first with forgiving yourself for being imperfect (a perfectly
natural state to be!).

### MASTER NUMBER 44 {.h3}

If you have a 44 Life Purpose Number and/or 44 Destiny Number, you have
the qualities of not only root number 8, but the Master Number 44.
(There is no 44 Day of Birth.)
:::

*Please read the meaning for number 8 (in [Chapter
3](#ch03.xhtml#ch03)), the "root number" for 44, as well*.

You embody the Practical Visionary and Ingenious Director, here to
empower others by restoring order and dedication in their life.

As a 44, you are ...

\* A builder and manifestor of group consciousness

\* Designed to create new modalities of greater income and abundance

\* Trusting of the order of the universe

You are very resourceful and able to manifest valuable ideas in service
to others. Your creations are designed to help others rebuild their
lives. Your mental abilities are great, as is your strength of
conviction. 44 exudes []{#ch04.xhtml#page_77 .pagebreak}a powerful
personality, which matches their expansive goals. As a 44 you have great
magnetism, leadership abilities, and powers of persistence and
self-control. These qualities allow you to reach the highest echelons of
power and wealth giving you a great capacity to serve the world.

You are innately practical and strong. Your *big* ideas germinate from
an expansive imagination, which is able to conceive of intricate and
grand visions. This ingeniousness allows you to manage and bring
together many different aspects of power and personalities---thereby
finding seemingly magical solutions to problems others can't solve. You
do this by including them in the process, allowing their ideas to blend
with the ultimate solution, thereby acting as leader, manager, and
magician all at once and bringing complex projects to a harmonious
conclusion. This natural genius for directing also stems from your
innate ability to analyze and reason while applying compassion and
leadership with total confidence and control.

There is a serenity and integrity in you that instantly allows others to
feel secure and grounded. You are just, efficient, strong, and
ethical---having both tact and an incisive intellect that wields
enormous power, as all your energy is poured into making your ideals and
ideas *real*.

You do not shy away from work and are tirelessly engaged with your
responsibilities and projects, reflecting the self-discipline and
tenaciousness required for any great leader or organizer. Like all the
Master Number vibrations 44 also requires high ideals and complete
integrity in order to be of service. Your great desire is to improve
people's lives, their quality of life, and you use your influence,
power, and fortune to manifest all levels of improvements and elevation
in your community.

When you as a Master Number 44 are out of alignment you become
inconsiderate, overworked, and overstressed. You use money to control
others, expect others to manifest your good ideas, have no personal
discipline, are critical behind the scenes and envious of others'
success, resist responsibility, and are dominated by your own ambitions.

As a 44 you use discipline, humility, perseverance, and total dedication
to stay on your soul's chosen path. Often your satisfaction for having
completed a goal brings the greatest fulfillment---you know that you
have prepared for this moment, this life, and the satisfaction of
completion is superior to any other reward you may receive.

gratitude

[]{#ch04.xhtml#page_79 .pagebreak}As a natural intuitive you need to
surrender to the subconscious realms. This allows you to come home to
love over and over again. When you are out of alignment you will become
oblivious of the spiritual realms and ignore your intuition and
responsibilities---even embracing victimization instead of spiritual
victory. Be aware that the strength of any Master Number will be
reflected in both the negative and positive expression of its meaning.

with 77 is the double lightning strike from heaven to Earth---a striking
shift that bubbles up in your conscious awareness quite miraculously.
You have the gift of tuning in to your spiritual guides and the angelic
realm without even being aware of your exquisite connection. 77
represents double intelligence and inventiveness, allowing you to reach
great heights of spiritual wisdom.

As a 77, you are ...

\* Able to penetrate straight into the core of any matter

\* Designed to release others from mental and spiritual pain

\* Able to share your intelligence with those who are afraid to take
risks, so their courage bubbles up inside of them and they are
energetically brought back into balance

10 is the vibration of "Instant Manifestation." This means you can
manifest ideas, thoughts, goals, and emotions easily and often
instantly. The in 10 adds an element of divine protection. Your words
also have a great impact on others. The strong implementation gifts of
this frequency carry a big responsibility---since your thoughts and
feelings *will* manifest whether they are positive or negative. So be
sure to see your life from a "glass half full" perspective as often as
possible. 10 is made up of 1 and 0---the straight line and
curve/circle---the building blocks of sacred geometry and the universe,
giving you direct access to cosmic wisdom. (Our computer code is made up
of 1s and 0s and indicates the expansive impact that the number 10

wisdom you seek. Remember, you carry a "knowingness" within you, so look
within when seeking a solution. When you focus on expanding your

you definitely have an "out-of-the-box" approach to life. You can
attract sudden changes that are meant to keep you alert and aware.
Birth, life, death, and rebirth is a consistent theme weaving through
all areas of your life. Thus you'll naturally experience many shifts as
twists and turns suddenly appear to replace the old and introduce new

The ancients associated the number 14 with the scribe. 14 is what I

imagination and great energy. You like excitement and motion yet must
stay on the positive expression of your number in order not to feel
unstable.

The shadow side of number 14 is expressed when you are out of alignment.
Watch for these clues: You are easily distracted, overly nervous and
stressed out, overanalytical, or neglectful of responsibilities or you

16 is a powerful number of spiritual transformation---symbolizing the
intuitive lightning strike of awakening. Listening to your inner voice,
a powerful message of number 7, is heightened even further in the 16, as
your intuition will always warn you of unexpected changes and even
danger---whether through dreams or your gut feelings. In order to live
at the highest expression of this powerful number of awakening, it is of
absolute importance for you to perfect your intuitive hunches, as
ignoring them can result in the immediate attraction of challenges. You
work best when you are alone. That's when you receive powerful and
sudden illuminations. You like to feel empowered. You also prefer
quality over quantity.

The shadow side of number 16 is expressed when you are out of alignment.
Watch for these clues: It is important for you to learn about being
faithful and honest, so be guarded against promiscuity and
unfaithfulness. Other shadow-side expressions are impatience,
overanalyzing, and being impulsive or reckless. A tyrannical side and
using words or actions in an abusive way are extreme negative

17 is what I refer to as the "Immortality Number." With this number in
your Birth Code you will leave behind a legacy---to your family, your

mysteries of the universe. You also want to help create peace and love
for humankind.

*"16 is a powerful number of spiritual transformation---symbolizing the

The ancients referred to 17 as the "Star of the Magi." It is a deeply
spiritual number, having also symbolized the eight-pointed Star of Venus
to the ancient Chaldeans. Often people with this number in their soul
Blueprint will have challenges earlier in life, which they overcome
later on---and so are able to align to love and peace. You have the
mindset and resilience of a true survivor.

The shadow side of number 17 is expressed when you are out of alignment.
Watch for these clues: Your challenge in life is to achieve a high
degree of detachment, in order to understand that power and influence
are only to be used for the benefit of uplifting others. You may be
stubborn and pessimistic and lose complete faith with where the world is
heading. These doubts can create a superficial quality that has its
roots in the meaningless aspects of life, not in natural ever-expanding
abundance and the infinite nature of the universe.

18 loves to dream and requires more time to rest in order for your
amazing imagination to become conscious. Your creativity and compassion
coupled with your natural charisma and intense emotions can carry you to
a leadership position. You have the capability to move mountains and
build empires. You are very sensitive to the rhythms of life. Sometimes
this high sensitivity turns into a nervous energy, so it is important
for you to meditate and chill on a regular basis.

The shadow side of number 18 is expressed when you are out of alignment.
Watch for these clues: Either you lead by inspiring others---or you can
mislead and are made as an example to others of what not to do. So,
[]{#ch05.xhtml#page_88 .pagebreak}you may use your power for the sake of
ego gratification. You may be touchy, easily irritated, deceived by
others, not aware of close dangers, or in a state of conflict about
spirituality and materialism, or you may consciously profit from
conflict.

The ancients called 19 the "Prince of Heaven," where the "prince"
symbolizes the Sun. 19 comprises both the first and last single-digits,
1 and 9, and represents a vibration of initiation, because you'll be
pushed to stand on your own two feet having accessed the gamut of wisdom
contained within the 1 and the 9. Thus you may attract many changes and
shifts in your life that require you to start from scratch.

You attract others into your energy field. You have a wonderful
creativity, which may be accompanied by equally strong insecurities.
Your purpose is to believe in yourself and to stand on your own two feet
by yourself. That is when you've reached true happiness and peace. Being
your own Sun!

[J]{.dropcap}[UST LIKE EVERY NUMBER CARRIES A UNIQUE MESSAGE, EACH
LETTER IN THE ALPHABET RESONATES TO A SPECIFIC MEANING.]{.f3} The
alphabet conveys sacred symbolism. It is a wonderful tool to access
another part of a person's soul contract and give a deeper, spiritual
meaning of words. Use this chapter as a key to discover how language,
names, and words impact you all day long. You'll be amazed at the
profound impact the numerology of letters has on your life.

[]{#ch06.xhtml#page_121 .pagebreak}Your current name and birth name are
made up of several letters. Some are your initials, some are repeated,
and others appear only once. Letters that begin or end a name carry
extra weight, as does the middle letter of a name, if the name has an
odd number of letters. (Discover the meaning of a letter's placement and
repeated letters in [chapter 11](#ch11.xhtml#ch11).)

You'll notice that all twenty-six letters look different. This is your
first clue that they impact you differently! As you discover the meaning
behind each letter, you'll see certain words that begin with that letter
in capitals. Pay attention to words and names that activate each letter
for even more insights.

*Pay particular attention to the letters that correspond to your
initials, the first vowel in each of your separate names, any doubled
letter that is side by side (like aNNa has two Ns next to each other,
and JiLL two Ls side by side), or letters that are repeated. These will
carry extra emphasis in your life (more in [chapter

A must decide quickly or else it will be overly Analytical.

A is the first letter of the alphabet and represents the Air we
breathe---the first breath we take when we are born. Say "Ah" and it
sounds like a breath. Thus A also is highly engaged and creative,
confident and active. The word "A" means "one," as in "A" house, "A"
picture.

A needs to curb its enthusiasm if it turns negative. This can be
expressed as being overly ambitious, self-important, egotistical, bossy,

V does not have a middle line separating the spiritual from the physical
realms, and the bottom of V is not balanced, so it is important for V to
[]{#ch06.xhtml#page_137 .pagebreak}study spiritual, metaphysical
modalities and practice some kind of meditation to stay balanced and
grounded.

I call 22 the "Buddha" number, making the V a peaceful, strong, and
determined leader. V is a completely straight-line letter and carries
great focus and clarity as well as awareness.

V can easily Visualize when the intention resonates with V's Soul
Blueprint and mission. With patience and a methodical approach, V can
accomplish anything.

V symbolizes a Vortex of energy, indicating a tremendous source of
manifestation power.

V likes Vitality mixed with Velocity and can live a life that is fast
paced---so V needs to get outdoors and exercise to stay balanced.

V needs to guard against being suspicious and selfish and feeling like a
Victim. A negative V may take a major risk and lose a lot in the
process.

[W]{.f1}/[23 & 5]{.f2}

::: group
#### **W = 23 AND 5** {.h4}

W is Wide open to the top (spiritual) and bottom (physical).

W resonates to the number 23, symbolizing the Royal Star of the Lion,
giving this letter great strength and a mysterious power.
:::

W is an upside-down M. It represents a person stretching out two
arms---and also looks like a Mountain range as does M. Where M shows two
mountains and one valley, W shows one mountain and two valleys. Thus W
goes deeply into the unconscious aspects to gather the resources in
order to climb the mountain of Wisdom. W can stand apart as mystical and
Wondrous.

W is also a 5 and thus magnetically attracts crowds and people. W knows
how to persuade and is a good letter for business, since W has the Will
to accomplish goals and Will get them done.

W needs to work at a mission where there is adventure, change, and much
activity---W does not do well in monotonous situations. W likes to think
quickly and has a knack for coming up with new ideas and new inventions.

The word "NEW" represents all three letters in the alphabet that
resonate to the number 5!

W is sensual (five senses) and loves deeply. W is generous and shares
with those it loves.

W in the negative can be impatient, cut corners, and cause
instability (not going into the valleys before climbing the mountain).
The up-and-down nature of W means there is a fluctuation of energy, in
which hasty actions might be regretted at a later time. W needs to Watch
Worry.

[]{#ch06.xhtml#page_138 .pagebreak}Wealth is attracted to W, while
health must be taken care of. Walking is Wonderful.

W represents the Woman and the Womb of Creation---and is a powerful
letter of Winning and Wisdom, representing an unbeatable strength that
allows W to transfer power to others. It is a very magnetic letter and
can accomplish rapid success.

**[THE HIGHEST VIBRATIONAL EXPRESSION OF]{.f3} W [IS WHEN]{.f3} ... W
has the Will to flow with the Winds of change and Walk into each
adventure with a Winning attitude and a Willingness to Wonder.**

[X]{.f1}/[24 & 6]{.f2}

::: group
#### **X = 24 AND 6** {.h4}

X is open on all sides and can be vulnerable.

X either exhibits a spiritual, high vibration or can be materialistic
and attracted to lower energies.
:::

X can have a bipolar-like or double personality.

X may "cross out" or put an X on progress and growth.

Or X may rush too fast into a situation and unwittingly push the delete
button.

X represents the number 24 and single-digit 6 of human love. X can bring
love into a situation but needs to guard against confusing sex with
loving intimacy. Love and sex are both related to the 6 vibration, which
has an X in the word "six". So, due to the openness of the X, it can be
amazingly open and ecstatic or it can be led astray by its sexual
desires.

XXX denotes a high sexual content of lower vibrational force.

A positive X has a wonderful strong intention to uplift humankind
through love, wisdom, intellectual knowledge, and inner strength.

A negative X can attract challenging karma and lead a life of turmoil.
It will seek pleasure at all costs and turn to the dark side for power
and answers. The word "hex" can apply to the negative applications of
this letter.

All 6 letters have deep emotions and have a need to be appreciated. Thus
X has a deep underlying need to help others, is artistic, holds strong,
passionate views, and makes a wonderful teacher and counselor.

**[THE HIGHEST VIBRATIONAL EXPRESSION OF]{.f3} X [IS WHEN ...]{.f3} X is
eXcited to serve humanity by opening all channels in service to love.**

[Y]{.f1}/[25 & 7]{.f2}

::: group
#### **Y = 25 AND 7** {.h4}

Y represents a fork in the road.

Y is the symbol of a decision and a person who is at a crossroads. A big
question is---which of two paths do I choose? Y introduces many choices
that need to be intuitively investigated.
:::

[]{#ch06.xhtml#page_139 .pagebreak}Y reaches to the heavens for answers.
As a 25 letter, Y is very psychic. So it must use its intuitive gifts to
listen and hear the answers it will inevitably seek to make choices.

Decisions will be the main theme in a Y person's life. They will
encompass going left or right, up or down, diving deeply or skimming the
surface, warm or cold, past or future.

Y must always choose the spiritual path.

As a letter made up only of straight lines, Y is very focused and clear.

Y resonates to the root number 7 and Yearns to know the mysteries of
life.

Y needs rest, quiet, nature, and peaceful surroundings.

Y's ability to listen will be especially important when quick decisions
need to be made---that is when Y must "trust their gut" for guidance.

A negative Y will feel moody, restless, intolerant of others,
overactive, and touchy. Y can be critical and quite self-centered, which
can lead to a fanatical approach to life.

Y looks like a dowsing rod and represents dowsing for gold, Yearning for
the golden nugget of truth.

**[THE HIGHEST VIBRATIONAL EXPRESSION OF]{.f3} Y [IS WHEN ...]{.f3} Y
sees both the Yin and Yang in You and Yearns to feel Youthful with a
Young attitude---saying a big Yes to life.**

[Z]{.f1}/[26 & 8]{.f2}

::: group
#### **Z = 26 AND 8** {.h4}

Z is the final letter of the Western alphabet, representing the Zenith.

Z is made up of two 7s that are joined as one horizontal line connected
by two horizontal lines---the upper symbolizing heaven and the lower
Earth. Thus Z can channel powerful wisdom between planes of existence.
:::

Z looks like a lightning bolt, signifying an electrical aspect to the
sudden insights this letter attracts.

Z is an N turned on its side and resembles an antenna. It can scan the
skies for ideas and manifest them into physical reality.

Z represents numbers 26 and 8---the number of infinite strength,
overcoming obstacles, leadership. As an 8 letter, Z can attract
abundance.

Z works well under pressure and has a great desire for achievement and
recognition. There is no limit (8) to what they can and will do to
manifest a successful outcome.

In the negative, Z may exaggerate and has a hard time sharing, so can be
challenging as a partner. If it abuses its natural power resources, it
can easily loose what it has gained. Z must always lead with integrity
and honorable intentions.

**[THE HIGHEST VIBRATIONAL EXPRESSION OF]{.f3} Z [IS WHEN]{.f3} ... Z
strives for the Zenith, embodying the powerful Zero-point---and a life
of Zen.**

## YOUR ASTROLOGY NUMBERS' CODE {.h2t}

[N]{.dropcap}[UMEROLOGY DESCRIBES THE ENERGY OF THE PLANET EARTH]{.f3}.
The numbers you see---the numbers in your Soul Blueprint, the numbers in
your name, and the numbers of your current cycles ([chapter
8](#ch08.xhtml#ch08))---are a description of your soul and your future
timelines. Just like you, the Earth and all beings emit vibrations that
are translatable as numbers.

The celestial bodies---our stars and planets---carry frequencies as
well. When we apply numerology to the position of the stars and planets
at the time of our birth and beyond, it expands our understanding of who
we are as divine beings that, after all, originated from the stars! Like
the numbers that appear in your Soul Blueprint, the numbers in your
astrology birth chart are specifically aligned to your cosmic code and
cosmic origins.

[]{#ch07.xhtml#page_141 .pagebreak}Astrology is the study of the
movements and positions of celestial bodies and their specific influence
and impact on us individually and collectively. It is usually seen as
separate from numerology. And yes, you can divine a person's soul code
with either science. However, you will uncover more layers and deeper
understanding when you utilize *both*.

Astro-numerology is a powerful modality---one that cannot be adequately
addressed in one chapter alone. However, this chapter will help you
discover how your birth planets and rising sign resonate to specific
degree numbers---and how those combinations impact you and your life.
Since we are discovering your soul Birth Code, we must also look at the
code in your stars at birth ...

### ANATOMY OF AN ASTROLOGY BIRTH CHART {.h3}

Here is an example of Oprah Winfrey's astrology birth chart---look at
all the degree numbers! The bold numbers inside the circle (within the
twelve "pie slices") are the degree numbers of the Sun and planets at
the moment []{#ch07.xhtml#page_142 .pagebreak}of Oprah's birth. The bold
numbers in the wheel on the outer rim are the degree numbers that begin
each of Oprah's twelve houses (you must know your exact birth time and
birth place to get the twelve houses).

As you can see, in astrology numbers are everywhere and thus form an
integral picture of your Soul Blueprint.

### HOW TO READ THE NUMBERS IN YOUR ASTROLOGY CHART {.h3}

If you know your exact birth time and place, you can construct a chart
with the twelve houses, where the beginning of each house resonates to a
specific degree number.
:::

If you already have your astrology birth chart, go grab it now. I also
recommend you follow the instructions below, so you can access the PDF
that lists your important astrology degree numbers. If you do not have
your natal birth chart, follow these instructions:

::: group
#### **GO TO [ASTRO.COM](http://ASTRO.COM)** {.h4}

1\. Click on My Astro (top right).

2\. Click on Create a horoscope immediately, as a Guest User.
:::

3\. Enter your birth information. *If you don't know your birth time,
enter 12:00 p.m*. Then click Continue.

4\. Under Horoscope Chart Drawings, click on Chart Drawing, Ascendant.

5\. A page with your astrology birth chart will appear.

6\. Click on Additional Tables (PDF).

7\. This is the PDF we will use to access the degree numbers in your
astrology birth chart.

Now let's look at the numbers in your astrology birth chart. (Even if
you don't know your exact time, you'll still be able to see most of the
important degree numbers in your birth planets---but you will not see
the degree numbers for your twelve houses.)

In the Planet Positions table on the next page you will see several
columns. There is only *one* column that is important to us---the
"Longitude" column. I have highlighted the area in this column that
shows exactly where the degree numbers are that you need to pay
attention to. Notice how in each case, it is the first number on the
left that has a degree symbol (°). This is the *only* number you need to
pay attention to.

What this table is showing are the exact degrees of the planets at the
moment you were born.

[]{#ch07.xhtml#page_145 .pagebreak}*"When we apply numerology to the
position of the stars and planets at the time of our birth and beyond,
it expands our understanding of who we are as divine beings that, after
all, originated from the stars!"*

If you do not know your exact birth time and place, then pay attention
to the Sun and all other planets, with the exception of the Moon. The
Moon changes one degree every two hours, so an exact birth time is
absolutely necessary to know your Moon degree number.

In our example, this person has a Sun at 6°. If you know your astrology
symbols, you'll see the Aries icon next to the Sun. For the purpose of
this book we will not be discussing Sun signs, only the degree numbers,
to give you a snapshot of the numerology formula of your astrology Birth
Code.

Go down the longitude column of the planet table and highlight or write
out all the numbers you see---so, for the Sun, Moon (if you have your
exact birth time), Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus,
Neptune, Pluto, the True Node (skip the Mean Node), and Chiron. This
will give you a set of twelve numbers (eleven if you don't count the
Moon).

Pay particular attention to the numbers of the Sun and personal
planets---Moon, Mercury, Venus, and Mars. But *all* the numbers
contribute another layer of information about you and your Soul
Blueprint.

Read a description of each of the numbers that appear in this column for
more insights into your soul code. Then apply each number to each
planet.

shown [here](#ch07.xhtml#page_143) are the essential meanings of the sun
and planets in the order they appear in the table.

Now combine the numbers with each planet. Go to [chapters
3](#ch03.xhtml#ch03), [4](#ch04.xhtml#ch04), and [5](#ch05.xhtml#ch05)
to check the meaning for each degree number and align it with the
meaning of the planet.

In our example, the Sun resonates to 6°, and means that this person's
identity is known to be warm, giving, in service and someone who takes
on responsibilities. His or her creative life force resonates to love.

Venus is aligned to 20°, revealing that this person places a high value
on cooperation, harmony, and uniting opposites. Creatively, this person
is balanced and imaginative. Money is an equal give and take, and in
general an awakening will take place in love, money, and values.

Neptune vibrates to 4°, unveiling an imagination that is easily
manifested and a compassion that is honest and real, while psychic gifts
may []{#ch07.xhtml#page_146 .pagebreak}be used for specific areas of
life---there's a mystery or enigma around how this person loves and uses
his or her intuitive gifts.

*"When you follow the numbers, you'll be shown a deeper picture
revealing a magic and mystery that otherwise would have been missed
altogether."*

Now let's apply these same numbers to the houses. You'll see the
"Houses" table to the right of the "Planet" table. (If you do not know
your exact birth time, you will not be able to check these degree
numbers. The ones that show up in your PDF are not correct.)

What you'll notice is that the first six numbers repeat again. So just
write down the first six degree numbers. In our examples those are 28°,
12°, 0°, 6°, and 23°.

Look up the meaning of each degree number in [chapters
3](#ch03.xhtml#ch03), [4](#ch04.xhtml#ch04), and [5](#ch05.xhtml#ch05).
Each of these planetary or house degree numbers adds a layer of
information to your Soul Blueprint.

If you notice that *any* of your Three Important Birth Numbers is also
reflected in your astrology birth chart, pay attention! This
cross-correlation is powerful and points out an intensification of that
number.

For any double-digit degree number, also check the corresponding
single-digit root number.

If you notice a particular emphasis on one (or more) of the three
numerology triads ([chapter 3](#ch03.xhtml#ch03)), make a note of that.
It is another layer of distinction for you that points out a vibrational
alignment emphasizing the Mind, Manifestation, or Creation.

::: group
#### []{#ch07.xhtml#page_147 .pagebreak}**REPEATED DEGREE NUMBERS** {.h4a}

Pay particular attention to:

\* Numbers that appear more than once---an intensification.

*In our example, the number* ***20*** *appears twice*.

*The number* ***7*** *appears twice*.

\* Single-digits that appear more than once---an intensification.

*In our example the numbers there are two 20s and one 29, all of which
reduce to the root number* ***2***, *which is an intensification of the
number 2*.

*There is also one* ***24*** *and one* ***6***, *an intensification of
the number* ***6***.

*In addition to the two* ***7s*** *we see one* ***25***, *an
intensification of the number* ***7***.
:::

You are now beginning to make connections that are profound. Numbers
"speak" to each other, and your astrology birth chart is widening the
scope of who you are at soul level. This awareness will help you feel
more at ease and secure in yourself---even reveal hidden gifts you
didn't know you had!

So often we can cut ourselves short by placing limits on our perception
of our potential. Your potential is aligned to be expressed in a
*limitless* way! When you follow the numbers, you'll be shown a deeper
picture, revealing a magic and mystery that otherwise would have been
missed altogether. Acknowledging who you are at soul level, unveiling
the unique beauty that is you, is the greatest gift you can give---to
yourself and others.

Live your life *without restrictions*. Dispose of self-judgment or
others' opinions of who you are. Rather, turn to the glory that is
you---revealed in your true soul code. You are here on Earth temporarily
experiencing your soul in a new, infinitely wonderful way. Your soul
code is a reminder of your divinity. There is only one way to
God---through self-awareness.

### THE THREE IMPORTANT NUMBERS IN YOUR PERSONAL CYCLES {.h3}

Your current and future cycles comprise:
:::

1\. Your **Personal Year---**the vibration you are experiencing from one
birthday to the next birthday

2\. Your **Personal Month**---each calendar month carries a specific
personal vibration for you

3\. Your **Personal Day**---every day carries a specific personal
vibration for you

Your Personal Cycles are an invitation to consciously participate in
creating your reality in the most optimal way possible. Once you get
into the rhythm of your yearly, monthly, and daily cycles, you hold the
keys to the natural ebb and flow of your life in full alignment with
your Soul Blueprint.

### HOW TO CALCULATE YOUR PERSONAL YEARS {.h3}

Let's begin with your Personal Year vibration. Some numerologists start
*everyone's* Personal Year on January 1. However, I have found with
reading thousands of clients that the shift we feel on New Year's Day is
related to the *Universal Year* Number changing, not our individual
Personal Year. You see, there are Universal Cycles, which impact
everyone collectively, and then your Personal Cycles, which are totally
unique to you. When the Universal Year number shifts every January 1, we
all feel the change. But your Personal Year begins on your birthday, not
on January 1.
:::

Astrology, too, focuses on the shift on your birthday. It is always on
your birthday that your solar-return astrology chart is created (when
the Sun returns to the exact position that it occupied at the moment of
your birth), to give you the energetic forecast of your next year---not
on January 1.

When you consider that the day you were born began your life, gave you
your Life Purpose Number (which was your first Personal Year on Earth!),
then it makes total sense to begin your next vibrational cycle on your
birthday every year. Besides, that's the day your age changes too!

Your Personal Year begins in the month of your birthday. You change your
age and your Personal Year on your birthday, not on January 1. So for a
birthday in June, your Personal Year (and your age) begins in June of
one year and runs until May the following year.

[]{#ch08.xhtml#page_152 .pagebreak}This means that within one calendar
year, a person born during any month except January would experience
*two* different Personal Year numbers:

1\. One carried over from the previous calendar year *until* their
birthday.

2\. One *from* their birthday month onwards.

Your current Personal Year is derived by adding the digits of your day
of birth and month of birth to the current calendar year and reducing to
a single digit. Every new Personal Year begins the month that you were
born in. Your next Personal Year number will be one digit lower unless
you're currently in a 9 Personal Year, in which case your next Personal
Year will be 1.

Let's look at some examples.

Your previous Personal Year number, which is active before your month of
birth in any given calendar year, is one digit lower than the current
year's (unless the current year's is a 1, in which case the previous
year's was a 9.)

Once you calculate your current yearly cycle, you can look back at
previous personal years and forward to coming personal year cycles to
gauge how these cycles have impacted you in the past and will impact you
moving forward.

### HOW TO CALCULATE YOUR PERSONAL MONTHS {.h3}

Your Personal Months change at the beginning of each month. To find your
Personal Month number, add the number of the month in question to your
single-digit Personal Year number.

In the example above, the person born on May 23 calculated a 4 Personal
Year in 2019. That means that her months are:

Note: September is the ninth month. Thus in September every year, your
Personal Month number is the same as your Personal Year number. This is
because adding 9 to any number and reducing the total sum to a single
digit results in the same number that you originally added to 9.

### HOW TO CALCULATE YOUR PERSONAL DAYS {.h3}

Take the Personal Month Number in question and add it to the day in
question.
:::

Personal Month \_\_ + Day = \_\_ Personal Day

For example, to find the Personal Day on **May 6, 2019,** for the person
born on May 23:

### []{#ch08.xhtml#page_156 .pagebreak}YOUR POWER CYCLES {.h3}

There are certain Personal Years, Months, and Days that activate one of
your Three Important Birth Numbers. When this happens you will feel an
intensification of energy. You'll experience profound growth and more
opportunities. These are your Power Cycles, and their enhancement
happens *any time a current Personal Cycle number aligns with one of the
numbers in your Soul Blueprint*.
:::

For example, if your Three Important Birth Numbers are 3, 7, and 4 (Day
of Birth, Life Purpose, and Destiny), you want to note any Personal
Year, Month, or Day that *also* resonates to 3, 7, or 4. So, if you are
experiencing a 4 Personal Year, Month, or Day, you are activating your 4
Destiny Number. Make a note of these upcoming Power Cycles! Knowing
about them will help you navigate your life with confidence and ease.
You'll be able to leverage the profound vibrational alignment that takes
place each and every time.

Keep in mind, you have several Power Cycle Personal Days each and every
month---no matter whether you are in a Power Cycle Personal Month and
Year or not! So you are never without this surge of energy.

You have some Days and Months when two of your Three Important Birth
Numbers are activated. This happens when a Personal Year and a Personal
Day both align with one of your Three Important Birth Numbers at the
same time. Or it can be a Personal Month and Personal Day.

Once in a while, if your Personal Year and Personal Month both activate
one of your Three Important Birth Numbers, you will have *triple
intensification* Power Cycle days! That is when the Personal Year,
Personal Month, and Personal Day *all* resonate to one of the Three
Important Numbers in your Birth Blueprint.

Take advantage of any Power Cycle activation. It is a green light from
the universe to your soul, letting you know---all systems go! Whatever
you experience during these Year, Month, or Day Power Cycles, it is
designed to up your game, lift you higher, and put you in greater touch
with the Light of God---your Spiritual Source.

Now let's discover the meaning of your Personal
Cycles\![]{#ch08.xhtml#page_157 .pagebreak}

YEARS,]{.f3} [MONTHS, AND DAYS]{.f3} as well as decipher when your Power
Cycles are, it's time to give all the numbers meaning! You will discover
how each number vibration, from 1 through 9, is activated. Use the
interpretation for each number for all your cycles---year, month, and
day.

::: group
### []{#ch09.xhtml#page_159 .pagebreak}9-YEAR CYCLES {.h3}

Every nine years you begin a new 9-year cycle, from Personal Year 1
through 9. Any time your 9-year cycle comes to an end (you are in a 9
Personal Year) or begins again (you are in a 1 Personal Year), you will
feel a major shift in your life. You are releasing old paradigms and
ways of being, people, and beliefs to make room for a rebirth.
:::

This "shift" also happens to a lesser degree when you transition from a
9 Personal Month to a 1 Personal Month, and even from a 9 Personal Day
to a 1 Personal Day.

As a reminder, your current and future cycles comprise:

1\. Your **Personal Year**---the vibration you are experiencing from one
birthday to the next birthday

2\. Your **Personal Month**---each calendar month carries a specific
personal vibration for you

3\. Your **Personal Day**---every day carries a specific personal
vibration for you

Whenever a Personal Day, Month, or Year is the same as one ofyour Three
Important Birth Numbers, the impact will intensify.

## ADDRESS NUMBERS {.h2t}

[A]{.dropcap}[S YOU CONTINUE READING THIS BOOK ON THE SECRET MEANING OF
NUMBERS]{.f3} you'll start noticing the numbers in your daily life more
and more. For example, each of the pages in this book is numbered! In
[chapters 3](#ch03.xhtml#ch03), [4](#ch04.xhtml#ch04), and
[5](#ch05.xhtml#ch05) you discovered the detailed meanings of all
single-digit and double-digit numbers. These three chapters are your
ultimate guide to the numbers in your daily life, including messages you
receive when you randomly open a page of any book.

[]{#ch10.xhtml#page_169 .pagebreak}Other more permanent prominent
numbers in your life are your address number, your phone number(s), the
number of children you have, even numbers you are drawn to. Look at each
number and read about it in [chapters 3](#ch03.xhtml#ch03) to
[5](#ch05.xhtml#ch05); it will tell you something about yourself in each
particular context.

There is so much more to understand about your life that is revealed day
to day in letters and numbers.

::: group
### DAILY SYMBOLS IN YOUR LIFE---YOUR DIRECT LINE TO SOURCE {.h3}

Let's say you ask a question, or there has been something on your mind
and you reach for a favorite book and open to shown
[here](#ch04.xhtml#page_78). That page number carries a message for you.
Even if you did not have a question in mind, you are receiving a message
from Spirit. The universe *loves* using numbers to communicate with your
soul, because numbers are so easy to find everywhere and, as you can
see---easy to understand. So, paying attention to the number messages
that come up for you several times a day allows you to connect with
Source all the time.
:::

Or let's say you look at the time and notice it's 1:09 p.m., for
example. Look at the overall message 1 + 0 + 9 = 10, which reduces to 1.
So this is a fresh, new-beginnings message for you. One that favors
honoring your originality and the energy surge that accompanies
furthering your idea, goal, or approach. Then you check *each* of the
individual numbers that make up the whole, in this case numbers 1, 0,
and 9, for an additional layer of meaning.

### ADDRESS VIBRATIONS {.h3}

Just as every person emits a special code, each address carries a
specific vibration. There are three important items you need to know
about your address number:
:::

\* Is it an overall fortunate vibration?

\* If yes, does the vibration resonate with one of your Three Important
Birth Numbers?

\* If not, what remedy can you use to introduce a secondary positive
influence?

Address numbers have different effects on your life, so it is important
to understand how your address affects you, whether it is your personal
address or business address. This knowledge alone will have a major
effect on your daily life. You'll be able to know which addresses keep
you in the flow, with minimal challenging interference and
distractions---and just as importantly, which do not.

::: group
#### []{#ch10.xhtml#page_170 .pagebreak}**HOW TO CALCULATE ANY ADDRESS** {.h4}

In any address that impacts your life, only the number is important to
you. You do not need to calculate the street name. The only instance
where a letter will be considered as part of the calculation process is
when a letter appears in your actual address number, such as 555 Cedar
St., **#9H.**
:::

Let's look at variations of addresses you may encounter in your life:
First write down the number of your address.

1\. For a simple street address, without an apartment number, simply
write down the number.

If you live at 4816 Main St., write down **4816**.

Add all the numbers until you can bring the total down to a single-digit
"root" number:

**4816** = 4 + 8 + 1 + 6 = **19**

**19** = 1 + 9 = **10**

**10** = 1 + 0 = **1**

The address number for this property is 1.

2\. If you live in an apartment or condo, you must calculate both the
street number of your whole building *and* the unit number of your condo
separately. Your building number is of lesser importance than the unit
number---since only the unit number is unique to you. The unit number is
your personal address vibration.

For 4816 Main St., \#**25:**

**25** = 2 + 5 = **7**

The address number for this unit is 7. We already know that 4816 Main
St. adds up to a "root" number of 1. But **7**, the unit number, *has
the greatest influence on the inhabitant(s)*. Number **1** for 4816 Main
St. has a secondary impact.

3\. For addresses with letters, you must add the numeric value for the
letter *with* and *without the equivalent number value of the letter*.

An address of 32 Apple Dr. #8B would be added:

8 + B = 8 + 2 = 10

10 = 1 + 0 = 1

Without the Letter B this address *also* vibrates to number 8. So this
condo unit activates both the numbers 1 and 8. It is important to
calculate *both* versions---with and without the letter---whenever a
[]{#ch10.xhtml#page_171 .pagebreak}number and letter are present. *Thus,
look at the number as a standalone vibration and the total of the number
and letter*.

#### **HOW YOUR ADDRESS ALIGNS WITH YOUR BIRTH CODE** {.h4}

Look at all the single-digits that make up your Three Important Birth
Numbers ([chapters 1](#ch01.xhtml#ch01) and [2](#ch02.xhtml#ch02)).
:::

Figure out which of the three triads they resonate to ([chapter
3](#ch03.xhtml#ch03)).

If *one* of your Three Important Birth Numbers is activated by your
single-digit address number, your address number will resonate with you.
However, you still need to check whether your address activates a
"challenging" vibration. Even if it resonates with you, it may attract
challenges if it is not connected to abundance.

resonates with the single-digit of your address, you are compatible with
the address*.

### REMEDIES FOR CHALLENGING ADDRESS NUMBERS (AND HOW TO ALIGN THESE TO YOUR SOUL BIRTH CODE) {.h3}

If an address number is either challenging or not in harmony with one of
your birth numbers, there is an easy remedy to diminish a challenging
address and infuse it with a secondary positive vibration.
:::

Place a number inside the front door---anywhere on the door, but it must
be *inside the main door* of the residence or office---thus facing into
the home.

This number is added to the single-digit address number.

Make sure the new digit double-digit and single-digit address number
resonates with one of the Three Important Numbers in your Birth Code.

Make sure the number is positive and is not listed in the "Avoid"
section.

For example, if you live in a 12 home (which is in the "Avoid" section
[]{#ch10.xhtml#page_177 .pagebreak}under 3 addresses), you want to add
the root number 3 (12 = 1 + 2 = 3) to a single-digit for which the new
sum reduces to a number that supports you.

Let's say you would like to add a secondary positive vibration that
reduces to 6. Add a 3 to the existing 3 (3 + 3 = 6). **Place a 3 inside
the front door** to your home or office or condo and start benefitting
from the fortunate secondary influence of a 6 address in your life.

Keep in mind, the dominant address vibration will still be 12 (which
reduces to 3). However, now you have diluted the influence of this
challenging address number by placing a 3 inside the front door, thus
creating a *new* secondary positive influence of number 6.

## REPEATED NUMBERS AND LETTERS: A MAGNIFICATION IN YOUR LIFE {.h2t}

[A]{.dropcap}[NY DOUBLE LETTER IN A NAME OR DOUBLE NUMBER IN A BIRTHDAY
OR CURRENT CYCLE MAGNIFIES THE ENERGY]{.f3}, creating an intensity that
needs to have a way to resolve. This is a good thing---a call to action
to step up in your area of expertise or area of learning. Either way,
you are expanding your influence on your life.

Your birth name and current name (which can often differ from your
birth-certificate name) may carry additional unique qualities. Let's
look now at intensifications---the impact of numbers or letters that are
repeated---a powerful magnification of a lesson and message.

::: group
### []{#ch11.xhtml#page_179 .pagebreak}DOUBLE LETTERS, INITIALS, LETTER INTENSIFICATIONS {.h3}

Intensifications in names come in three forms:
:::

1\. Letters that are doubled within a single name.

2\. Initials in which the same letter is repeated.

3\. A higher than average occurrence of a specific letter in our name.

If you are born with an intensification in your birth name, it has a
lifelong impact. If it occurs in a current name that you have chosen,
the impact lasts while you use that name.

1\. A double letter appears when you have *two consecutive letters
within one name that are the same*. For example my last name,
"Gabrielle," has a double L. The name "Mado**nn**a" has a double N,
"Brad Pi**tt**" has a double T, "Eckhart To**ll**e" has a double L,
"D**ee**pak Chopra" has a double E, "E**mm**a Thompson" has a double M,
and "Joh**nn**y De**pp**" has both a double N and a double P.

2\. Another way that a letter can carry a deep impact on your life is
when *any of the letters in your initials are repeated*. Examples of
this are **H**ay **H**ouse and **H**oward **H**ughes (HH) (HH),
**W**ayne **W**. Dyer (WWD), **D**aniel **D**ay-Lewis (DDL), **S**teven
**S**pielberg and **S**usan **S**arandon (SS), **C**alvin **C**oolidge
(CC), **R**onald **R**eagan and **R**obert **R**edford (RR), and
**M**arilyn **M**onroe (MM).

3\. The final way a letter carries a deeper impact is when it appears
*more often than average* in your *birth* name. If you have more than
the average of letters in any group, that is an intensification.

Here is the average number of times each letter family appears in a
given birth-certificate name:

::: group
#### **A, J, S (NUMBER 1)** {.h4}

You must stay active! Your mind is filled with ideas, and movement to
fulfill your goals is vital for your well-being. When you feel
stimulated by a project you can go for it with boundless energy
reserves. You know how to start but not necessarily how to complete
(unless you have other prominent letters or initials that signify
completion). You can make decisions quickly---and if you don't, you will
feel out of sorts. You have the courage to stand up for yourself and are
very independent. Leadership fits you like a glove. When you can express
your highly innovative and original ideas, you are most happy. Guard
against self-centeredness, arrogance, single-mindedness to the point of
excluding others, and aggression.
:::

::: group
#### **B, K, T (NUMBER 2)** {.h4}

You know how to cooperate and often provide a soothing peaceful presence
for others. You are highly sensitive (which can easily get your feelings
hurt). For this reason you want to be accepted and liked by others and
[]{#ch11.xhtml#page_181 .pagebreak}may go beyond your comfort zone to
please. Practice not taking criticism personally and focusing on the
facts, not your worries or fears. Receiving emotional reassurance, even
through human touch (a hug, the holding of your hand), imbues you with
joy and confidence. You may need a partner to feel comfortable moving
forward, unless you have a strong presence of number 1 or 8 letters in
your birth name. You can adapt easily to people and change.
:::

::: group
#### **C, L, U (NUMBER 3)** {.h4}

You are very artistic and must have a way to express yourself
creatively. Explore all there is to explore regarding writing, music,
dance, or art. You crave creating something with your life that brings
beauty and joy and uplifts others in some way. You tend to be romantic.
Guard against distractions and spending time on frivolous things. You
may have a tendency to scatter your creative energy by focusing on too
many endeavors. Your natural sweet nature and childlike qualities may at
times turn into childishness---this is when you act irresponsibly and
don't stick to your daily routines and goals. You like to talk or
write---it's your way of sharing feelings. Watch overspending without
regard to a set budget.
:::

::: group
#### **D, M, V (NUMBER 4)** {.h4}

You actually enjoy work and have tremendous self-discipline. People can
rely on you to deliver. Manifestation and implementation are your gifts.
Having a plan, schedule, or routine suits you well. You tend to
overprepare so as not to loose control---including spending an
inordinate amount of time getting ready for a social occasion. Try not
to get to caught up in the details. Also guard against rigidness. Having
an achievement or goal to focus on will allow you not to get stuck in a
rut, as you might lock yourself into a relationship or career that is no
longer elevating your life. Keep your life flowing and be open to new
ideas and different ways of seeing things. Family is important to you.
:::

::: group
#### **E, N, W (NUMBER 5)** {.h4}

Change and adapting to new conditions is natural for you. You are fun
loving and need your freedom above all else. You enjoy traveling and
being in the media spotlight. If you don't have a project to focus on,
you can get restless and be prone to irritability. You are very sensual
and need an outlet for your natural sensuality. Guard against
multitasking and losing the original thread of your daily or overall
goal. When you feel passionate []{#ch11.xhtml#page_182 .pagebreak}about
something---whether it is a product or performance---you know how to
"sell" it to anyone no matter what your profession is. Be sure to
exercise so you can release some of your restless energy. You have an
innate sense of humor---use it to see the humor in all of life.

You are devoted to family and love to nurture others. You are highly
sensitive to energy and aesthetics and feel best when your environment
is beautiful and the relationships in your life are all harmonious.
Disharmony will distract you from your mission to love and uplift with
grace and gratitude. Being of service is a natural for you; however, you
must guard against giving too much at the expense of your own
well-being. Having a secure, lovely home is vital to your
happiness---you love to decorate and make everything beautiful. Be
careful about taking control to the point of meddling in other people's
lives.

#### **G, P, Y (NUMBER 7)** {.h4}

This intensification enhances your ability to analyze and research
subjects with great depth and beyond any boundaries. Your concentration
goes a long way in allowing you to understand and retain knowledge.
Practicing some kind of meditation is important for your well-being. You
may get too "into your head"---the abstract entices you yet needs to be
balanced with heart-centered feelings---trust your intuition! You like
to ask a lot of questions (which may irritate others) and need alone
time to process your tangential discoveries. Guard against isolating
yourself and coming off as a "know-it-all." Due to your highly sensitive
nature, any enhanced substances (drugs, alcohol) are not recommended.
Your highly distinct body of work has the potential to transform people.
:::

::: group
#### **H, Q, Z (NUMBER 8)** {.h4}

You are highly motivated to accomplish a body of work that brings you

powerful aura has a major impact on people when you walk into a room.
Guard against overpowering others and coming off as authoritarian, or
being impatient and judgmental with those who are slower to understand.
You desire to make a change in the world---be sure to pay attention to
changing yourself as well. You do best when in a leadership position and
can leave behind a lasting legacy. You desire quality and will strive to
secure the highest possible outcome. Overcoming obstacles strengthens
your resolve to succeed.
:::

[]{#ch11.xhtml#page_184 .pagebreak}*"If you are born with an

You love to serve from a place of unconditional love and wisdom.
Clearing old cobwebs---past patterns of behavior and outdated
paradigms---is your specialty. You reach beyond personal love---and
activate universal compassion. Forgiveness is one of the keys to your
inner peace and happiness. You are a humanitarian, sharing resources and
being of service for a higher purpose. Guard against wanting to "save
the world" and helping others at the expense of dissipating your own
energy and resources. You have an innate artistic nature and must have a
way to create and use your powerful imagination.

### MISSING LETTERS {.h3}

In [chapter 2](#ch02.xhtml#ch02) you learned how to assign each letter
in your given birth name to a number. Did you happen to notice if there
was any number from 1 to 9 that was missing? Most people do not have all
nine numbers represented in their birth name. If you notice one or more
numbers that are not represented, check out the meaning of your missing
number below.
:::

First, turn to your birth name again. Assign each letter to the
corresponding number.

one of the numbers missing in your name is prominent in your Birth Code
(Day of Birth or Life Purpose Number), the impact is greatly lessened or
even completely negated.

::: group
#### **MISSING NUMBER 1** {.h4}

Missing the 1 vibration is unusual and indicates you can be more
interested in others' welfare than in yourself. You will be prompted to
assert yourself, be courageous, be more independent, and make your own
decisions. You have a naturally lovely nature and must stand your ground
when around strong-willed people.
:::

Don't waste any energy on what others may think of you. Be
self-confident and promote yourself. Trust in your ability to make good
judgments. Have the courage to act on your strong convictions.

::: group
#### **MISSING NUMBER 2** {.h4}

Missing the 2 vibration indicates you must practice cooperating with
others as you refine your listening skills. Being tactful and caring and
exhibiting the utmost patience are often required in order to come to a
resolution or be able to proceed. You may need to stay in the background
and learn to be part of a team. Be sensitive to other people's emotional
states and needs.
:::

You will find yourself in situations where patience, peace of mind,
conflict resolution, and attention to details are required in order to
achieve your goals.

::: group
#### **MISSING NUMBER 3** {.h4}

Missing the 3 vibration can indicate your lack of experience with fun
and spontaneous creativity. Lightening up and seeing the humor in life
will allow your inner child to express your innate joy and passion. You
truly yearn to freely express your happiness in all that you say and do,
so use your imagination without placing any boundaries! Focus on staying
positive---you are here to explore how to play. Do things "just for the
fun of it."
:::

::: group
#### **MISSING NUMBER 4** {.h4}

Missing the 4 vibration means you need to establish a methodical and
disciplined approach to your life. Structure is vital to your success.
Otherwise you will feel like you are drifting, and results will be
fleeting and few. If you []{#ch11.xhtml#page_186 .pagebreak}focus and
use discipline you will be able to master your gifts at the highest
levels. Apply yourself through diligent work. A combination of
concentration and order will enable you to express and foster your
natural talents.
:::

::: group
#### **MISSING NUMBER 5** {.h4}

Missing the 5 vibration is seldom found in Western names, since letters
E and/or N are usually present. You may have a dislike of crowds and a
desire to be left alone. Learn to embrace change. Adapting to new
circumstances will be important in your life. Guard against being rigid
and inflexible. Trust and have faith. You will learn a great deal
through experience and embracing freedom. Communicating your thoughts
and feelings needs to be practiced.
:::

::: group
#### **MISSING NUMBER 6** {.h4}

Missing the number 6 may mean committing to long-term relationships is
more challenging. You need to learn to show your true emotions. You may
need to take on extra family responsibilities, which broaden your
understanding of responsibility and nurturing. You may feel isolated and
lonely yet not understand why. Instead of being guarded in your
relationships, open up your heart, and you will discover the magic of
feeling deep compassion and love.
:::

::: group
#### **MISSING NUMBER 7** {.h4}

Missing the 7 vibration means you may not naturally want to look more
deeply at issues or understand the "why" and "hows" of life. Your
interest in underlying motives and reasons or asking questions to get
more information is not as strong. You may be less cautious than others
and less prone to analyze. One of your lessons is to have faith and to
trust. At times you may not to trust yourself and others. You are here
to rediscover the power of your immortal soul and to trust that Source
is your home.
:::

::: group
#### **MISSING NUMBER 8** {.h4}

Missing the 8 vibration means you are highly independent. The number 8
can, surprisingly, be missing even in the names of highly successful
people. No 8s can signify less strain about finances in the long run and
more support coming from others who will step in and help you achieve
your goals. Or you may just not make financial abundance and power a
major focus in your life. You are less likely to want to take a leading
role.
:::

::: group
#### []{#ch11.xhtml#page_187 .pagebreak}**MISSING NUMBER 9** {.h4}

Missing the 9 is rare and means you are learning about human nature and
may be asked to feel more compassion, tolerance, and understanding for
others. Experiences will ask you to expand your heart-center and connect
and engage emotionally. You have great potential to influence your own
destiny and the destiny of others once you stop withholding energy to

### SHAPE OF LETTERS---STRAIGHT, CURVED, OR COMBINATION? {.h3}

Each letter in the alphabet forms an image. This image is drawn with
either straight lines, curved lines, or a combination of both. Most
people have two or three initials---the first letters of their names. As
you know, every letter is also a number with a powerful symbolic
meaning. But what about the shape of the first letters of your name? The
image of your initials reveals even more about your disposition and
approach to life.
:::

Now we will delve deeper into the sacred geometry of letter images,
since they reveal hidden information about the quality of every
letter---and how it affects your life.

**The first letter of each of your names is always capitalized. This
brings extra attention, and thus the impact and influence on your life
is enhanced as well.**

Are the first letters of your names both curved and straight? For
example, the letters B, G, J, and R have both curves *and* straight
lines.

Or are all the letters straight lined only, such as M, T, A, and Y?

Or do you have capital letters that are all curved, like the letters S,
O, and C?

### DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOUR BIRTH AND CURRENT NAME {.h3}

In [chapter 2](#ch02.xhtml#ch02) you discovered how to calculate your
birth-certificate name and arrive at your Destiny Number. You cannot
change this number---it is your Birth Code. Just as you can't change
your birthday, birth time, or birth place.
:::

(If you are adopted and your birth name is officially changed on your
birth certificate *before* 6 months of age, you will take on your new
adopted name as your Destiny Number.)

Whereas you only have one birth name, current names can change a few
times in the course of a lifetime, sometimes through marriage and other
times through choice. Many people have more than one current name---they
use a middle initial in some areas (like bank accounts or credit cards)
and not others, or they have a nickname that is used with friends and
family and another name professionally. (Remember, any time you change a
letter, add a letter, or subtract a letter your whole name frequency
changes---it is a matter of math.)

Current names are a unique, separate branch of numerology. They are
calculated using a very complex set of rules and a completely different
numerology alphabet---the Chaldean system. The impact of your current
name on your life is completely different as well. It does not describe
you in any way; however, your current name number does show how easy or
[]{#ch11.xhtml#page_189 .pagebreak}challenging it is for you to fulfill
your birth promise. There is not enough space in this book to cover the
intricate rules on how to check and change current name vibrations.

### DNA NUMEROLOGY CODES IN FAMILIES {.h3}

Once you begin playing with and paying attention to numbers, you may
notice how certain numbers appear more frequently in your life---and in
the codes for the people closest to you. This is no coincidence! All
energy aligns to similar vibrational frequencies.
:::

You can notice this often in families. There may be one number that many
family members share. Or a "family of numbers" appears over and over
again, like 3-6-9 or 2-4-8 or 1-5-7. This is a spiritual DNA numerology
code that links families to each other. I have seen each parent share a
different number with their child---for example the child has an 11/2
and 6, and one parent shares the 11/2 and the other the 6, forging a
connection. Sometimes certain children align more closely to one parent,
and you can see that in their Birth Code.

You'll notice how you will share certain numbers with your close friends
or colleagues.

Let's discover how to interpret number sequences---so you can start
receiving messages from Spirit!

### []{#ch12.xhtml#page_191 .pagebreak}PATTERNS AND SEQUENCES: CREATING MOMENTUM {.h3}

*The meaning of patterns, such as 3030 or 5566, and sequences, such as
1-2-3-4 or 3-6-9*.
:::

Whenever you notice a pattern or sequence, the universe is sending you a
message. Patterns exist in nature, in geometry, in music. You can't help
but pay attention to a rhythmic pattern, color code, or number's
sequence---your mind is being elevated and your soul inspired to listen.

In [chapters 3](#ch03.xhtml#ch03) and [4](#ch04.xhtml#ch04) you
discovered the meaning of each individual digit from 1 through 9 and the
Master Numbers (11, 22, 33, etc.). Keeping the meanings of these numbers
handy, let's look at a few common sequences and patterns that will help
you decipher future sightings with ease.

::: group
#### **CONSECUTIVE NUMBERS SEQUENCES** {.h4}

Whenever you see a consecutive numbers sequence, such as 1--2--3--4 or
2--4--6--8 or 9--8--7, *momentum* is generated. Momentum is a powerful
call to action. Movement creates direction---thus a sequence is always
moving somewhere.
:::

Any sequence can be continued, sometimes in both directions! So, when
you notice a sequence, you are being called to **follow through** on an
idea, insight, project, or conversation---whatever has been appearing in
your life at the moment that you see the sequence needs your passionate
devotion and supreme attention.

When the number sequence **rises upwards**, as in 4--7--10--13, you are
gathering steam, lifting into a higher vibration, getting *energized*.
Looking at the first and last number in the particular sequence
**4**--7--10--**13**, notice that the sequential pattern is created as
the numbers rise up by a count of 3---symbolizing creativity,
self-expression, and joy. Look even closer and notice the first and last
numbers in this pattern---4 and 13. Number 13 can be reduced to a "root
number" of 4 (13 = 1 + 3 = 4). So the number 4 figures at the beginning
*and* end of this 4--7--10--13 sequence, and that means an
intensification of the number 4 must also be taken into account.

4 stands for getting organized, making a step-by-step plan, implementing
a more disciplined approach, and thinking outside the box---while
maintaining boundaries. In this case the *rising* nature of the sequence
inspires you to take your **creative self-expression** and apply it to
an endeavor that makes you **happy** while making sure you **follow
through with a plan of action that brings security and stability.** This
will enable your life to *rise up* to a higher level of well-being. As a
result, a greater fulfillment naturally propels your goals and energizes
you.

[]{#ch12.xhtml#page_192
.pagebreak}![Image](./f0192-01.jpg){#f0192-01}
:::

[]{#ch12.xhtml#page_193 .pagebreak}When the number sequences **go
downwards**, as in 27--25--23, you are pivoting in a new direction and
changing course in some way as a result of letting go of a past idea,
behavior, or decision. So pay attention to insights, synchronicities,
and clues on how you are to proceed next. A downward motion indicates
the energy is slowing down to help you gain wisdom about what has
transpired. This "relaxing" of energy allows you to take a moment to
breathe and reflect so you can make an inspired, informed decision on
how to proceed. A falling sequence is a call to review and
release---readying you vibrationally so you are energized for the next
lift off!

This is very similar energy to when a planet is retrograding in
astrology. Once you know the meaning of the number or planet that is in
a "reflect and review" motion, you can recognize, assimilate, and apply
it into your life with greater ease and grace.

In the example 27--25--23, the numbers are falling by a value of 2. Make
note of this whenever there is a pattern. Number 2 adds an important
message to the story line, of bringing something into balance,
communicating with another, and creating harmony and peace through
cooperation, sensitivity, and kindness.

All sequences indicate movement in a very clear direction. Make sure
that you assimilate and interpret ...

1\. The meanings of the individual numbers

2\. The value number of the sequence (is it going up or down by 1, 2, 3,
etc.?)

3\. The upwards or downwards direction message

If the numbers rise or fall without a discernable pattern, such as
5--7--11, note the direction of the sequence (rising or falling) and
read the specific meanings of the numbers involved.

::: group
#### **SEQUENCES THAT MOVE IN BOTH DIRECTIONS** {.h4}

Occasionally you will see a sequence that is composed of an up **and** a
down numerical pattern.
:::

For example, 5, 2, 8, 3, 11, 4.

In this case there is a 5-8-11 pattern merged with a 2-3-4 pattern.
Since both individual sequences are moving upwards, this would still be
considered mainly a rising sequence with some additional downward
"release and review" energy added.

::: group
#### []{#ch12.xhtml#page_194 .pagebreak}**REPEATED NUMBER PATTERNS** {.h4}

Whether one single number repeats two or more times (such as 555, 77,
660, 3388) or the repeated numbers are embedded around or within other
numbers (as in 3**77**2, **88**4, 1**99**80), repeated number patterns
create an *intensification* of a specific number. Its corresponding
meaning is always enhanced and very significant to you.
:::

Intensifications are clearly designed to grab your attention through
repetition! Anything you experience more than once has a greater
likelihood to stick.

When you notice a repetition of any number, first look up what the
meaning of that number is. If the pattern is defined but just one
number, such as in 555, 88, or 220, then look up the meaning of the
digit, and you'll get a clear message of how one area in your life is
being intensified. (Remember that 0 is not a value; however, 0 will
enhance any sequence or pattern.)

If you notice a repetition of the number 555, for example, it is an
indication of change, a possible unexpected turn of events, a quick
decision, and an invitation to take that risk, be more adventurous, and
explore greater freedom and independence. On the other hand, seeing
multiples of 8, such as 88, places a strong emphasis on gaining more
courage, stepping into leadership, focusing on manifesting abundance,
paying attention to financial flow, overcoming obstacles, or manifesting
your vision.

When you see an intensification of a number while it is embedded with
one or more other numbers, look at the meaning of the repeated number
first. Then check the meaning of all other numbers (that are not doubled
up) to add an additional layer of understanding.

Going back to our 555 example: If the pattern is changed to 5554, then
the overall freedom and adventure experience is the most important, with
an added message that in claiming independence and taking a risk, you
will ultimately also experience security, plus the process may require
greater and more meticulous attention to detail.

In another example, the difference in changing 88 to 2880 means your
financial abundance or big vision is expanded through one-on-one
communication, relationships, and creating more balance in some area in
your life.

As you begin "speaking the language" of the single digits ([chapter
3](#ch03.xhtml#ch03)) and the double-digit Master Numbers ([chapter
4](#ch04.xhtml#ch04)), you'll discover a wonderful new modality, a
language of the soul. Decisions will be easier, insights instantaneous,
and inspiration accessible at any time. Interpreting the symbolic
language of the universe will open vaults of wisdom---answers will be
there, at your service, at all times of day and night!

### 11:11---ENTER THROUGH THE PORTAL OF TIMELESSNESS {.h3}

Most likely you've experienced seeing 11:11 on a digital clock.
Something happens in that moment---like waking up from a deep sleep,
seeing 11:11 stops you in your tracks, even for a split second, and you
feel suspended somehow. Waking from a dream can leave you feeling
bewildered ... as if you are in between two worlds, hovering. Something
is crystal clear, vividly alive for just a moment.
:::

When the double 11:11 portal appears, you may feel suspended in time---a
wondrous floating sensation of momentary timelessness. It's a connection
that is undeniable, and hard to describe, because it transcends our
human mind---it feels otherworldly. Anytime you step through a door into
another room or building or garden, you enter a new zone---literally or
symbolically your space has changed. Stepping over any *threshold*
translates into an internal *shift*.

And so it is upon witnessing the 11:11.

At the moment 11:11 appears, *you cross a threshold* and forge a
connection.

As you learned in [chapter 4](#ch04.xhtml#ch04), the number 11 is a
gateway aligning your heart with the love of God. So, anytime you
experience the 11:11, it is an open invitation from the universe, your
spiritual guides, the angelic realms, to listen up and tune in, because
a divine message---however small---is asking for your attention!

The momentary suspension when you see 11:11 hovers in "no time" (a
reminder that you are never separate from God). You feel in that instant
at **one** with the universe. There is no past, no future. All you know
is the present moment---all else is unknown---*and not important*. This
is the major gift of 11:11---that the past and future are no longer on
your mind and of interest anymore. You are set free to experience life
the way it is meant to be experienced, without worry and without
projection. True living only happens right now.

[]{#ch12.xhtml#page_196 .pagebreak}*"In our digital age the presence of
numbers opens the door to continual communication with the divine."*

You are ultimate stillness and ultimate motion at once. You are yin and
yang---everything and nothing---the ultimate expression of the 11 portal
experience.

Anytime you are witness to 11:11, it is a spiritual wake-up call to
embrace the unexpected. All inspiration comes from this unknown
space---an infinite void of pure, pulsating potential. Creation is born
in this void. Worry does not exist here---as worry is a projection of
past experiences (the known) into the present (the unknown). So 11:11
beckons you to wake up to now---where fear is nonexistent.

*The illusion of separation from divine Source ends the moment you trust
in its eternal presence in your life*.

One thing is certain: It's not possible to go back once you've crossed
the threshold. Like life or death, once you cross into another realm of
existence, your experience cannot be erased or reversed. In the same
way, the insights and illuminations, small and large, that you receive
upon seeing 11:11 leave a lasting internal awakening.

::: group
#### **11:11---GATEWAY OF LIGHT** {.h4}

The letter values of the word "light" add up to 29, which reduces to 11
(29 = 2 + 9 = 11). 11 is the number of light; 11:11 magnifies the light
of truth in your life.
:::

*When you see 11:11, light is illuminating an issue in your life,
shining the light in darkness, enlightening you with inspiration ... In
order to walk through the two pillars, you must leave everything
behind---all preconceived ideas, beliefs, suppositions, expectations,
worries, fears, the past---and embrace the only constant: eternal life
and timelessness*.

As you fully immerse your energy into now, many doors will start to
open. As you realize you are never alone, your confidence soars. You
accept your true divine origin. You feel invincible. Because you are!
You have reconnected with our true self at soul level.

There is no greater serenity. No greater joy!

All pain, sorrow, confusion, envy, anger, hatred, fear, and jealousy is
transmuted when you surrender to the 11:11 present-moment experience.

[]{#ch12.xhtml#page_197 .pagebreak}In the human experience we need
contrast to appreciate the diversity of life. Contrast allows us to
recognize and discern what we want. We need to experience loneliness to
appreciate oneness, sadness to appreciate joy, dark to recognize light,
war to choose peace, aggression to feel the gift of kindness. 11:11
reminds you: The only thing that matters is that you are connected to
**all** of life as an expression of divinity itself. There is no
judgment in this place of love. No good or bad. There is just life
itself ... the passion for living fully.

Even as others may still judge you (and you them), you are set free of
personalizing their issues with you when you live in this eternal
space---and you will not take their judgments to heart. Your heart is
now cleansed, as you begin to realize that judgment is only a projection
born of ignorance---a lack of understanding. No one can cross the
threshold with you; no one has walked in your shoes.

*11:11 reminds you that you are an eternal flame, and to yourself only
shall you be true. Let others be. Love them, forgive them, be kind to
them---but you focus only on how you can rise to any occasion. A life of
rising is a life lived fully and exquisitely*.

::: group
#### **11:11---A CALL TO ACTIVATE ABUNDANCE** {.h4}

Engaging consistently with your internal light (through your living soul
code and your guides) is how you access and *activate abundance*.
:::

If you are self-conscious and not actually fully present, you're only
half aware---pretending to be fully there. Yes, you can function---you
can answer, you can respond---but you are not fully tuned into your
heart and soul through *intentional listening*.

When you open up completely, with no strings attached---stepping through
the 11 gateway by risking everything to be fully present---**you unlock
the secret key of abundance**.

Abundance manifestation cannot be separated from the rest of your life.
Many find this concept challenging ... *What you do and feel and say
every day is how you do and say and feel about everything else*. 11:11
invites you to play like a child would, to explore and enjoy the act of
creating your life every moment of your day. To live in prosperity, with
joyful anticipation, the internal and external must align. Your feelings
and intentions must be in sync---be *one* and the same. This is the key
to money manifestation. Clear all your resistance and emotional debris,
and you create room for the universe to bring you abundant gifts.

Abundance follows your *energy*.

money, in harmony with financial flow, you cannot easily generate it.
Inner fulfillment enriches you on all levels.

In this beautiful space fear is magically absent. You can't get attached
to the past or worry about future outcomes when you are totally engaged
with what's in front of you. 11:11 is a reminder of your constant
connection to Source.

All the abundance you could ever imagine already exists. The universe is
*expanding* constantly. There is no lack of good fortune and prosperity.
Reset your inner palate to vibrate at a highly positive frequency and
watch your natural, childlike passion create magical outcomes.

#### **DECODING 11:11---CREATING CONSCIOUS MANIFESTATION** {.h4}

A mathematical view of 11:11 reveals more about this profound spiritual
activation:
:::

**11:11 = 2 + 2 = 4**

2 is the number of balance, peace, connection, tenderness, sensitivity,
and awareness. 2 represents loving communication with another. It can be
two people, or you and an entity, or an intimate conversation as you
listen to guidance from your inner voice, your intuition. In its highest
expression, 2 facilitates communication with the divine realms.

2 + 2 represents the lines of communication between you and the
universe. The first 2 is you listening to your intuition, and the second
2 is you experiencing a connection with Spirit.

Adding the single-digits of 11:11 results in the number 4 (1 + 1 + 1 + 1
= 4). 4 is the symbol of making your ideas real---manifestation into
physical reality. Thus embedded in every 11:11 experience is the urge to
*make your inspirations manifest*. You are consciously applying the
subtle message (received in a moment of timeless suspension) ... into
action.

Think of it another way. When you are engaged in an activity that
fulfills you to the core, time flies, right? You're in love with what
you are creating or doing, and it's as if time doesn't exist at all.
Now, imagine if you could bring that quality to your everyday life. When
you live every moment with conscious awareness, no matter how mundane it
may seem to you at the time, and you engage fully with the task at hand
or the person you are talking to, then division and separation end. You
stop feeling divided, torn, and incomplete.

11:11 says to you: The universe has your back! The force is with you!
Take charge of this moment!

#### []{#ch12.xhtml#page_199 .pagebreak}**11:11 MEDITATION** {.h4}

Trusting your hunches is inspiration, being one with Spirit. Inspiration
means "in spirit."
:::

In these fast-paced and hectic times, the volume of information we need
to navigate day in and day out is astonishing. We are inundated with
news, sounds, interruptions, endless to-do lists and distractions---an
overload of stimuli overwhelming our nervous systems. Being too
stimulated can get you out of sync, exhausted, and unfocused, and then
it's easy to get ungrounded, untethered, and imbalanced. You'll know
right away, because you start to take things *personally*. Emotional
overwhelm results in partaking in unnecessary drama, as you separate
from Source only to feel alone, unsupported, and unloved.

When you find yourself in this state, invoke the 11:11 code.

\* Visualize the 11:11 on a big screen in front of you (choose a serene
color). or write 11:11 down on a piece of paper.

\* Inhale deep, long breaths for a few minutes while visualizing the
11:11 code.

\* Enter the 11:11 portal.

Now set the following intentions:

1\. I am open to embracing the unexpected and seeing opportunity
everywhere.

2\. I am totally present.

3\. I completely trust that everything occurring in my life is always
for my highest good and the highest good of others.

Feel free to visualize and set your intention while listening to
beautiful music. (I recommend classical music, as its beauty and
complexity naturally take you into heavenly spheres.) Bask your heart
and soul in your vision as you enter through the timeless 11:11 portal.

Now you are *one* with the universe. You can *play*!

Connect this way with Spirit anytime, anywhere.

11:11 is a tool, helping you create an *instantaneous moment of
illumination*.

Walk through the 11:11 gateway with no agenda ... only a pure intention
to embrace joy. *Now you are receptive to divine inspiration and can
fill your cup until it runneth over!*

When you open up to endless possibilities---risking all to be
present---you unlock the secret to abundance and bliss.

You're now in manifestation mode!

Now go and manifest money, miracles and magic!

Keep aligning with Source through your soul code, listen for intuitive
prompts, and always be guided by love.

I would like to acknowledge the support and inspiration of my daughter,
Clara, whose love of numerology, astrology, and music and thirst for
wisdom have brought infinite joy into my life each and every day.

I thank Pythagoras, the great philosopher, musician, mathematician,
numerologist, astronomer, and astrologer, and subject of the first book
on numerology I pulled off a bookshelf in a spiritual bookstore in
Amherst, Massachusetts, while I was a student at the college. This book
featured Pythagoras's spiritual teachings on numerology and changed my
life.

Thank you to my father for introducing me to astrology as a
teenager---his love of all things spiritual and the hidden nature of
life still fuels my quest for wisdom to this day.

So much gratitude to my wonderful core team---Nancy, AJ, and
Jelena---for your dedication and patience during the book creation
process. Also to Angela, Heidii, and Paula for your continual work and
support. It is because of you that the powerful message in the stars and
numbers continues to expand and uplift!

Big thank-you to Jill Alexander for your support and encouragement!

Finally, to all my students and clients---I've learned so much from you
and appreciate your trust and support! It has been a profound honor to
share and teach the wonderful world of star codes over these many years,
and I hope you find this ultimate guide as much of a delight to read and
apply as it has been to write!
