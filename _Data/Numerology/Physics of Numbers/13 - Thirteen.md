## Thirteen - 13

Self - 1.

Balance - 3.

The Self begins to percieve through the Heart Core that all vibrations of all Archetypes and all types of Relationships have a perfect point of Balance, a space where they are all in Union. This is the awakening of the Center of the 12 Points, and the unlocking of the experience of Creation (4) in the Heart. The Individual can now see the perfect balance in the Other, and this is the Key to the experience of Love and Re-Union
