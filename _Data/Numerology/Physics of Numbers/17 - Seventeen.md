## Seventeen - 17

Self - 1.

Rationality in the Other - 7.

Here the need for vibration to communicate begins to dissolve, as observation of the Mind in the Other allows the Self to realize that it is in fact part of the Rationality of Others. Communication in its higher form begins to be observed as a direct exchange of thought, as the Minds of others become present in the Mind of the Self.

The observation of thought in the Other also opens a door for the observation of thought in the Self, which can allow a bridge into the perception of Time (7+1=8) and Infinity to open.
