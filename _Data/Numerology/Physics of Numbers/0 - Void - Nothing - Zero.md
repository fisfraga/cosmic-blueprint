## Void - Nothing - Zero - 0

The Void is Infinite Potential.

Before time, before space, before anything, there was nothing. An emptiness pregnant with the very essence of everything, for everything emerged from it. Undefinable, unlimited, unbounded, and composed of the Mystery itself, the Real Zero can not be conceived, as it is primary to the act of conception.

This is the Divine Womb, the Sacred Circle, the Sacred Mother of All.
