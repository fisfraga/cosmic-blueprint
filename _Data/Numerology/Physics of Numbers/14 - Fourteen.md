## Fourteen - 14

Self - 1.

Creation - 4.

When the Self observes the experience of Creation in the Other, the Purpose for this dance of Archetypes and Relationships can be seen. One perceives Creation, now what? This is the moment of purpose, where the Self has an opportunity to participate, and the experience of Physicality emerges on a higher-dimensional plane, where it is part of an exchange of Physical experience with the Other, instead of simply the Self as an Individual.
