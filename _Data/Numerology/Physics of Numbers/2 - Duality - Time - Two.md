## Duality - Time - Two - 2

Time begins in the first moment.

Interaction, relationship, polarity. 

In that beginning there is suddenly a differentiation between the Eternal Union and movement within that union. There is a difference between being in the womb, one with the body of the Mother, and emerging in birth to become something different.

Inherent in two is the first breath, the first division, the initiation of Duality. In the birth of the Universe, the first moment in time also gives rise to the first separation between heat and cold (or less hot), light and dark, thick and thin, fast and slow, positive and negative charge, and the root of all other permutations of duality.
