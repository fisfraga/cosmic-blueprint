## Eleven - 11

Self - 1.

Everything Else - 1.

Being the One, perceiving the Infinite Potential of nothingness becoming existence, the Other is suddenly present. In this moment, the Self is seen to be One of something that is more than One. There is another One, which is Everything.

These are the Gates of the Heart, the Pillars of Atlantis. Through the Gate of the Infinite Self perceiving the Infinite Other, the alchemy of Yin and Yang are born yet again, and Time begins. Relationship is Born. The Heart Awakens.
