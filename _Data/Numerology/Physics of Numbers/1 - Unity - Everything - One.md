## Unity - Everything - One - 1

Eternity is Unity.

Infinite potential is made manifest in itself, but is still Infinite. There is no separation between the zero and the one, because the moment you are conscious of the nothing, it is now something. The nothing and the everything are the same, as neither can exist without each other. There is no division in the Infinite; no time passes in the Eternal. The Real One cannot be defined, as it is primary to the act of definition.

This is the Divine Gift, the Creator, the Sacred Father of All.
