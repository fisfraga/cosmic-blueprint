## Sixteen - 16

Self - 1.

Emotionality in the Other - 6.

As communication progresses in the Throat Chakra, so does the fine tuning of awareness of the source of each Physical exchange, and the vibration inherent in these exchanges. Here the Harmonic Trinity of 5+5+5 finds its Center Point, and the many different elements of language and communication merge through vibration into Union (6+1=7, spectrum into White-Light, see [Seven](http://adamapollo.info/sacred_knowledge/unified_harmonic_matrix/index.php#rationality)).

Here new dynamics of Creation also emerge (4x4=16), where the limitless potential of Creative Communication become a reality through the Collective.
