## Eternal Present - Nine - 9

The act of stepping outside the observation of Space-Time itself, is the act of stepping into the Eternal Potential. From the state of the Infinite Everything, one returns to the Nothing.

Similar to the form of a Phi Spiral, where does the 9 begin, and where does it end? It curls inward or outward, forming the motion of the weave of existence. It is the Harmonic Trinity of Trinities (3x3=9), and is the symbol for the Perfection of All as the Golden Mean.

Nine is the gateway back to the original essence of Creation, the fertile Womb of existence where the Everything and Nothing are One...are Zero. 10
