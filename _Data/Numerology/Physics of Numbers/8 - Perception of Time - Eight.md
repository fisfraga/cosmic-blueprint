## Perception of Time - Eight - 8


The Mind is viewed objectively, it can be seen changing in its many patterns as they unfold in Time. Stepping outside the Mind is also the act of stepping outside of Light itself, which is the very essence of Space-Time, vibration, and experience. 

In this way, Eight is like a gateway into the Infinite again, where the emergence of Space-Time itself can be observed, and Consciousness is the Light that permeates it, changing across Eternity.
